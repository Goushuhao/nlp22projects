T cell immunity is central for the control of viral infections. To characterize T cell immunity, but also for the development of vaccines, identification of exact viral T cell epitopes is fundamental. Here we identify and characterize multiple dominant and subdominant SARS-CoV-2 HLA class I and HLA-DR peptides as potential T cell epitopes in COVID-19 convalescent and unexposed individuals. SARS-CoV-2-specific peptides enabled detection of post-infectious T cell immunity, even in seronegative convalescent individuals. Cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 peptides revealed pre-existing T cell responses in 81% of unexposed individuals and validated similarity with common cold coronaviruses, providing a functional basis for heterologous immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Diversity of SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses was associated with mild symptoms of COVID-19, providing evidence that immunity requires recognition of multiple epitopes. Together, the proposed SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes enable identification of heterologous and post-infectious T cell immunity and facilitate development of diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic measures for COVID-19.",1,t2_blqmw,2020-10-01 00:28:50,/r/COVID19/comments/j2lxmx/sarscov2derived_peptides_define_heterologous_and/g76q6e3/,0

## Abstract

Background: There is disagreement about whether hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is effective as prophylaxis for COVID-19. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized trials that study the effectiveness of HCQ to prevent COVID-19. Methods and Findings: A search of PubMed, Embase, medRxiv, and clinicaltrials.gov found three completed randomized trials: one pre-exposure prophylaxis trial and two post-exposure prophylaxis trials. We obtained or calculated the risk ratio of COVID-19 diagnosis for assignment to HCQ versus no HCQ (either placebo or usual care) for each trial, and then pooled the risk ratio estimates. The risk ratio estimated for each of the individual trials were 0.74 (95% CI 0.50-1.10), 0.83 (95% CI: 0.58-1.18), and 0.69 (95% CI: 0.35-1.37). The pooled risk ratio estimate was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.61-0.99). All three trials found a similar rate of adverse effects in the HCQ and no HCQ groups. Discussion: The available evidence indicates that HCQ reduces the risk of COVID-19 by about 20%. Yet the findings from the randomized trials were widely interpreted as evidence of lack of effectiveness of HCQ, simply because they were not statistically significant when taking them individually. Completion of the ongoing prophylaxis trials is needed to generate more precise estimates of the effectiveness of HCQ to prevent COVID-19.",2,t2_2g8zpegv,2020-10-01 00:42:44,/r/COVID19/comments/j2plcg/brief_communication_a_metaanalysis_of_randomized/g76sc2k/,0

But the blobs exist in a smooth continuum of sizes, and the rate at which they fall to the ground will vary with airflow, temperature, humidity, etc., and ""pretty soon"" is an inexact standard for time.

There's no formal or strict distinction between the two, and it seems like the novel coronavirus spans that fuzzy boundary.

I can't help think the absence of a fan shortage means we're not giving ventilation enough attention as an NPI. I do see many local businesses that seem to be opening windows and running their HVAC louder than usual.

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j1cgjk,t1_g775oml,g77fzdj,"Yes, this seems to be true - at least by the measures we have other than actually trying to infect people. We see more antibodies, more neutralization activity (how quickly the antibodies destroy the virus). A few things let vaccines do this:

- Since a vaccine doesn't replicate in your body and make you sick, the vaccine can include a much larger dose of the molecules that you want your immune system to attack (in this case, the spike protein that allows the coronavirus to attach itself to cells). A dose of vaccine might have tens of billions of particles. That much virus might kill you.
- One of the ways the virus does make you sick is by attacking your immune system itself. This is particularly true for people with moderate to severe COVID-19, and the elderly - they have signs of depressed immune systems for quite a while after infection. If you give the vaccine to a healthy person, their immune system is in good shape and will be able to build stronger immunity.
- Vaccines can be tailored to produce just the most effective type of immunity. When a virus like SARS-CoV-2 enters your body, your immune system goes to work trying to make molecules that fit around different parts of it like a lock and key. It's kind of trial and error. But remember what I said about the spike protein? We know from research into other coronaviruses that having your immune system attack the spike is most important to fighting them. And indeed, we see that in people who are infected, antibodies that bind to the spike correlate more with neutralizing the virus than antibodies that bind to other parts. So the vaccines don't bother with the other stuff and are just all spike. Also, the immune system acts differently if it's fighting viruses versus if it's fighting parasites. If you get a ""parasite"" reaction to a virus (called Th2), the immune system is actually making things worse, and this seems to happen sometimes in people who get severely sick. The vaccines are tuned to give an effective anti-viral response (called Th1).",6,t2_593zf,2020-10-01 03:17:55,/r/COVID19/comments/j1cgjk/weekly_question_thread_week_of_september_28/g77fzdj/,0

Of course that's also a continuum, and even the low end of the arbitrary cutoffs for droplet/aerosol diameter is still much bigger than the virus (implying there's presumably some water in there too, just less).

If the mods prefer a peer-reviewed source questioning the dichotomy, here's Bahl et al., from Morgenstern's references:

&gt; Moreover, evidence suggests that infections cannot neatly be separated into the dichotomy of droplet versus airborne transmission routes. Available studies also show that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the air, and remain viable 3 hours after aerosolization. The weight of combined evidence supports airborne precautions for the occupational health and safety of health workers treating patients with COVID-19.

Just kinda curious because I have a family member who has to isolate for 14 days despite having a negative test and no symptoms.",2,t2_86j43snp,2020-10-01 04:30:05,/r/COVID19/comments/j1cgjk/weekly_question_thread_week_of_september_28/g77ro3c/,0

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j2u582,t3_j2u582,g77sf1n," **Importance**  Health care workers (HCWs) caring for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are at risk of exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Currently, to our knowledge, there is no effective pharmacologic prophylaxis for individuals at risk.

**Objective**  To evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in hospital-based HCWs with exposure to patients with COVID-19 using a pre-exposure prophylaxis strategy.

**Design, Setting, and Participants**  This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (the Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19 With Hydroxychloroquine Study) was conducted at 2 tertiary urban hospitals, with enrollment from April 9, 2020, to July 14, 2020; follow-up ended August 4, 2020. The trial randomized 132 full-time, hospital-based HCWs (physicians, nurses, certified nursing assistants, emergency technicians, and respiratory therapists), of whom 125 were initially asymptomatic and had negative results for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab. The trial was terminated early for futility before reaching a planned enrollment of 200 participants.

**Interventions**  Hydroxychloroquine, 600 mg, daily, or size-matched placebo taken orally for 8 weeks.

**Main Outcomes and Measures**  The primary outcome was the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection as determined by a nasopharyngeal swab during the 8 weeks of treatment. Secondary outcomes included adverse effects, treatment discontinuation, presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, frequency of QTc prolongation, and clinical outcomes for SARS-CoV-2–positive participants.

**Results**  Of the 132 randomized participants (median age, 33 years \[range, 20-66 years\]; 91 women \[69%\]), 125 (94.7%) were evaluable for the primary outcome. There was no significant difference in infection rates in participants randomized to receive hydroxychloroquine compared with placebo (4 of 64 \[6.3%\] vs 4 of 61 \[6.6%\]; *P* \&gt; .99). Mild adverse events were more common in participants taking hydroxychloroquine compared with placebo (45% vs 26%; *P* = .04); rates of treatment discontinuation were similar in both arms (19% vs 16%; *P* = .81). The median change in QTc (baseline to 4-week evaluation) did not differ between arms (hydroxychloroquine: 4 milliseconds; 95% CI, −9 to 17; vs placebo: 3 milliseconds; 95% CI, −5 to 11; *P* = .98). Of the 8 participants with positive results for SARS-CoV-2 (6.4%), 6 developed viral symptoms; none required hospitalization, and all clinically recovered.

**Conclusions and Relevance**  In this randomized clinical trial, although limited by early termination, there was no clinical benefit of hydroxychloroquine administered daily for 8 weeks as pre-exposure prophylaxis in hospital-based HCWs exposed to patients with COVID-19.",7,t2_2kp79xf3,2020-10-01 04:35:04,/r/COVID19/comments/j2u582/efficacy_and_safety_of_hydroxychloroquine_vs/g77sf1n/,0

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j1cgjk,t1_g77s5aq,g77ulaz,"Scientists don't predict that. Mass media predicts that based on scientists saying ""here's the least you can expect from an approved vaccine, we predict the vaccine is still helpful to slow or end the pandemic at these low rates of effectiveness."" There's also a bit of knowing where the goal post is. Is it ending infections permanently, or just keeping people from getting severely ill? A vaccine might be 50% effective at the former but 95% effective at the latter.

It isn't fully known how strong post-infection immunity is. It seems to be good - studies out of Mexico and Qatar show a very low rate of reinfections so far at the population level (&lt;0.3% in Mexico, 0.01% in Qatar). But people are still isolating and taking precautions, time will tell.

Edit: The current vaccine candidates all also have a weakness: they're injected, which should prevent infection from reaching places where your blood circulates, like your lungs, GI tract, etc. However the immune system has different types of antibodies that circulate in mucus that might only be stimulated by contact with mucus membranes. This goes back to the ""what's the goalpost"" question. If a vaccine prevents you from getting severe COVID-19 with heart and lung effects, but you still get a mild flu-like upper respiratory disease, did the vaccine ""work""? There are trials underway to see if two of the leading candidates (developed by Oxford and Imperial College London) can be delivered as a nasal spray.

And lastly, if you've ever designed and built anything complex, you can have a design that works perfectly on paper, but then when you build it and deploy it, it breaks, because the real world doesn't work the way your model did. That's why we have phase 3 efficacy trials and don't just jump the gun to administering vaccines before they've been road-tested.",5,t2_593zf,2020-10-01 04:48:55,/r/COVID19/comments/j1cgjk/weekly_question_thread_week_of_september_28/g77ulaz/,0

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j2p1na,t3_j2p1na,g77vuug,I tire of these ivermectin papers and the dogmatic fanboys they attract to this sub and the fact that they are published in journals no one has ever heard of. Like can we get real and good comparisons from known reputable places? This one's OK but small n for a lot of these comparisons. Is it really prudent to compare a group of 1 with a group of 11 and say there was an effect out of a total 100+ people in each group? Looks like they were doing something right to begin with and the ivermectin had little effect on the symptoms but was associated with reduced hospital stay. I would have liked to hear more about that which seemed to be the main finding but they didn't really go into it. I also find it odd that they reported few overall respiritory symptoms and not much low O2 but then some 60 people needed supplementary oxygen in the non iver group how does that make sense? Overall groups seem similar to begin with symptom wise but they they claim big effect of ivermectin. As usual no note on how they determined viral clearance. I'm sure some of yall ivermectin fans can chime in,2,t2_405k71y8,2020-10-01 04:56:26,/r/COVID19/comments/j2p1na/ivermectin_treatment_may_improve_the_prognosis_of/g77vuug/,0

Strikingly, East Asians had only 8% more Neanderthal ancestry compared to Europeans, in contrast to previous reports of 20%. ""This suggests that most of the Neanderthal ancestry that individuals have today can be traced back to a common hybridization event involving the population ancestral to all non-Africans, occurring shortly after the Out-of-Africa dispersal,"" Akey says.

Please show me the evidence for correlation between the percentage of Neanderthal DNA in your genome and severity of disease. 

In fact, that does not seem to be the case if you look at the global distribution of the allele in question (using the more common proxy here).

## Abstract

Objective--To determine if hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) reduces the incidence of new illness, hospitalization or death among outpatients at risk for or infected with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Design--Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials. Data sources--Search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, medRxiv, PROSPERO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Also review of reference lists from recent meta-analyses. Study selection--Randomized clinical trials in which participants were treated with HCQ or placebo/standard-of-care for pre-exposure prophylaxis, post-exposure prophylaxis, or outpatient therapy for COVID-19. Methods--Two investigators independently extracted data on trial design and outcomes. Medication side effects and adverse reactions were also assessed. The primary outcome was COVID-19 hospitalization or death. When unavailable, new COVID-19 infection was used. We calculated random effects meta-analysis according to the method of DerSimonian and Laird. Heterogeneity between the studies was evaluated by calculation of Cochran Q and I2 parameters. An Egger funnel plot was drawn to investigate publication bias. We also calculated the fixed effects meta-analysis summary of the five studies. All calculations were done in Excel, and results were considered to be statistically significant at a two-sided threshold of P=.05.

Results--Five randomized controlled clinical trials enrolling 5,577 patients were included. HCQ was associated with a 24% reduction in COVID-19 infection, hospitalization or death, P=.025 (RR, 0.76 \[95% CI, 0.59 to 0.97\]). No serious adverse cardiac events were reported. The most common side effects were gastrointestinal. Conclusion--Hydroxychloroquine use in outpatients reduces the incidence of the composite outcome of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and death. Serious adverse events were not reported and cardiac arrhythmia was rare.",1,t2_2g8zpegv,2020-10-01 07:26:10,/r/COVID19/comments/j2wy1r/randomized_controlled_trials_of_early_ambulatory/g78ctvj/,0

This is a ridiculously insignificant amount of infections to make any sort of real world prescription, therefore it's inconclusive. They do acknowledge it in their limitations.

The author had a much more difficult time with this since the studies were so disparate. New infections from study A may show HCQ's benefit (although not statistically significant) but study A might show HCQ had more hospitalizations. Study B might show a good trend with hospitalizations but more deaths. Study C might show less deaths but more infections, and so on.

I didn't read all the aggregated studies but the point is that the author glossed over those other endpoints while sort of picking and choosing the ones he wanted to put in his model. In the Mitja study of over **2000 people** for example, he opted to look at death reduction in the HCQ group while ignoring that transmission was higher for that same group. This both perplexes and worries me since there were only 13 deaths total in that study but there were a couple hundred infections. The author justifies this by giving little weight to this study in his calculations even though it had the largest number of participants. Had he substituted deaths for new infections in his model and weighed the study accordingly, I suspect his conclusion would have changed. I don't have the study's Excel sheet though so I can't be certain.

His conclusion is also that ""HCQ was associated with a 24% reduction in COVID-19 infection, hospitalization **or** death, P=.025"". If true, we don't know if HCQ helps with new infections, hospitalizations, **or** death. He should do a meta-analysis for each individual outcome instead of trying to combine them all together in this study.

**Background**

High number of SARS CoV2 infected patients has overburdened healthcare delivery system, particularly in low-income countries. In the recent past many studies from the developed countries have been published on the prevalence of SARS CoV2 antibodies and the risk factors of COVID 19 in healthcare-workers but little is known from developing countries.

**Methods**

This cross-sectional study was conducted on prevalence of SARS CoV2 antibody and risk factors for seropositivity in HCWs in tertiary care hospitals of Peshawar city, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province Pakistan. 

**Findings**

The overall seroprevalence of SARS CoV2 antibodies was 30.7% (CI, 27.8 to 33.6) in 1011 HCWs. Laboratory technicians had the highest seropositivity (50.0%, CI, 31.8 to 68.1). Risk analysis revealed that wearing face-mask and observing social-distancing within a family could reduce the risk (OR:0.67. p&lt;0.05) and (OR:0.73. p&lt;0.05) while the odds of seropositivity were higher among those attending funeral and visiting local-markets (OR:1.83. p&lt;0.05) and (OR:1.66. p&lt;0.01). In Univariable analysis, being a nursing staff and a paramedical staff led to higher risk of seropositivity (OR:1.58. p&lt; 0.05), (OR:1.79. p&lt; 0.05). Fever (OR:2.36, CI, 1.52 to 3.68) and loss of smell (OR:2.95, CI: 1.46 to 5.98) were significantly associated with increased risk of seropositivity (p&lt;0.01). Among the seropositive HCWs, 165 (53.2%) had no symptoms at all while 145 (46.8%) had one or more symptoms. 

**Interpretation**

The high prevalence of SARS CoV2 antibodies in HCWs warrants for better training and use of protective measure to reduce their risk. Early detection of asymptomatic HCWs may be of special importance because they are likely to be potential threat to others during the active phase of viremia.",1,t2_blqmw,2020-10-01 15:28:07,/r/COVID19/comments/j340nj/seroprevalence_and_risk_factors_of_sars_cov2_in/g79kf3m/,0

Our aim was to assess the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection after the lockdown in a sample of the Corsican population. Between 16th April and 15th June 2020, 2,312 residual sera were collected from patients having carried out a blood analysis in one of the participating laboratories. Residual sera obtained from persons of all ages were tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG using the EUROIMMUN enzyme immunoassay kit for semiquantitative detection of IgG antibodies against S1 domain of viral spike protein (ELISA-S). Borderline and positive samples in ELISA-S were also tested with an in-house virus neutralization test (VNT). Prevalence values were adjusted for sex and age. A total of 1,973 residual sera samples were included in the study. The overall seroprevalence based on ELISA-S was 5.27% [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.33-6.35] and 5.46% [4.51-6.57] after adjustment. Gender was not associated with IgG detection. However, significant differences were observed between age groups (p-value = 1 E-5) and particularly for people being younger than 50 years of age (Odd ratio (OR) = 2.86 95% CI [1.80- 4.53]; p-value &lt;0.000001*). The prevalence of neutralizing antibody titers ≥40 was of 3% [2.28-3.84].

**Objectives**

We evaluated widely-used SARS-CoV-2 serological tests and their potential association with virus neutralization test (VNT) in a cohort of mild COVID-19 patients. 

**Methods**

A total of 439 specimens were longitudinally collected from 76 healthcare workers with RT-PCR-confirmed mild COVID-19. Nine serological assays developed by leading global companies (Abbott, DiaSorin, Siemens, Bio-Rad, Wantai, bioMerieux, Euroimmun) were assessed. For each test the sensitivity to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was determined weekly after symptom onset. Correlation and concordance were assessed using the Spearman and Cohen Kappa coefficients, respectively. Positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement (NPA) with the VNT were also determined.

**Results**

The Wantai Total Ab assay targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) within the S protein presented the best sensitivity at different times during the course of disease. The best correlation between antibody level and neutralizing antibody titer was found with the Euroimmun S1-based IgA assay (Spearman coefficient [95%CI]: 0.71 [0.61-0.79]). A moderate concordance (Kappa [95%CI]: 0.43[0.23-0.63]) as well as the lowest NPA (33%) was found between the Wantai Total Ab assay and the VNT. Compared to the Wantai Total Ab assay, other total Ab or IgG assays targeting the S or the RBD (bioMerieux, DiaSorin, Siemens,) were more concordant with the VNT (Kappa&gt;0.7 for the three tests) and had a higher NPA (range: 90% to 97%). 

**Conclusions**

Although some assays presented a better concordance with VNT than others, the present findings emphasize that commercialized serological tests including those targeting the RBD cannot substitute VNT for the assessment of functional antibody response.",1,t2_blqmw,2020-10-01 15:34:43,/r/COVID19/comments/j343fr/evaluation_of_highthroughput_sarscov2_serological/g79ksgk/,0

As the SARS-Cov-2 virus spreads around the world afflicting millions of people, it has undergone divergent genetic mutations. Although most of these mutations are expected to be inconsequential, some mutations in the spike protein structure have been hypothesized to affect the critical stage at which the virus invades human cells, which could affect transmission probability and disease expression. If true, then we expect an increased growth rate of reported COVID-19 cases in regions dominated by viruses with these altered proteins. We modeled early global infection dynamics based on clade assignment along with other demographic and meteorological factors previously found to be important. Clade, but not variant D614G which has been associated with increased viral load, enhanced our ability to describe early COVID-19 growth dynamics. Including clade identity in models significantly improved predictions over earlier work based only on weather and demographic variables. In particular, higher proportions of clade 19A and 19B were negatively correlated with COVID-19 growth rate, whereas higher proportions of 20A and 20C were positively correlated with growth rate. A strong interaction between the prevalence of clade 20C and relative humidity suggests that the impact of clade identity might be more important when coupled with certain weather conditions. In particular, 20C an 20A generate the highest growth rates when coupled with low humidity. Projections based on data through April 2020 suggest that, without intervention, COVID-19 has the potential to grow more quickly in regions dominated by the 20A and 20C clades, including most of South and North America.",1,t2_blqmw,2020-10-01 15:37:13,/r/COVID19/comments/j344u8/virus_evolution_affected_early_covid19_spread/g79kxf0/,0

The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has gravely impacted societies around the world. Outbreaks in different parts of the globe are shaped by repeated introductions of new lineages and subsequent local transmission of those lineages. Here, we sequenced 3940 SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes from Washington State to characterize how the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Washington State (USA) was shaped by differences in timing of mitigation strategies across counties, as well as by repeated introductions of viral lineages into the state. Additionally, we show that the increase in frequency of a potentially more transmissible viral variant (614G) over time can potentially be explained by regional mobility differences and multiple introductions of 614G, but not the other variant (614D) into the state. At an individual level, we see evidence of higher viral loads in patients infected with the 614G variant. However, using clinical records data, we do not find any evidence that the 614G variant impacts clinical severity or patient outcomes. Overall, this suggests that at least to date, the behavior of individuals has been more important in shaping the course of the pandemic than changes in the virus.",3,t2_blqmw,2020-10-01 15:37:56,/r/COVID19/comments/j3453t/viral_genomes_reveal_patterns_of_the_sarscov2/g79kyun/,0

**Abstract**

The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly throughout the world. In the UK, the initial peak was in April 2020; in the county of Norfolk (UK) and surrounding areas, which has a stable, low-density population, over 3,200 cases were reported between March and August 2020. As part of the activities of the national COVID-19 Genomics Consortium (COG-UK) we undertook whole genome sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes present in positive clinical samples from the Norfolk region. These samples were collected by four major hospitals, multiple minor hospitals, care facilities and community organisations within Norfolk and surrounding areas. We combined clinical metadata with the sequencing data from regional SARS-CoV-2 genomes to understand the origins, genetic variation, transmission and expansion (spread) of the virus within the region and provide context nationally. Data were fed back into the national effort for pandemic management, whilst simultaneously being used to assist local outbreak analyses. Overall, 1,565 positive samples (172 per 100,000 population) from 1,376 cases were evaluated; for 140 cases between two and six samples were available providing longitudinal data. This represented 42.6% of all positive samples identified by hospital testing in the region and encompassed those with clinical need, and health and care workers and their families. 1,035 cases had genome sequences of sufficient quality to provide phylogenetic lineages. These genomes belonged to 26 distinct global lineages, indicating that there were multiple separate introductions into the region. 

Furthermore, 100 genetically-distinct UK lineages were detected demonstrating local evolution, at a rate of ~2 SNPs per month, and multiple co-occurring lineages as the pandemic progressed. Our analysis: identified a sublineage associated with 6 care facilities; found no evidence of reinfection in longitudinal samples; ruled out a nosocomial outbreak; identified 16 lineages in key workers which were not in patients indicating infection control measures were effective; found the D614G spike protein mutation which is linked to increased transmissibility dominates the samples and rapidly confirmed relatedness of cases in an outbreak at a food processing facility. The large-scale genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2-positive samples has provided valuable additional data for public health epidemiology in the Norfolk region, and will continue to help identify and untangle hidden transmission chains as the pandemic evolves.",1,t2_blqmw,2020-10-01 15:39:45,/r/COVID19/comments/j345up/large_scale_sequencing_of_sarscov2_genomes_from/g79l2jk/,0

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j347zz,t3_j347zz,g79lejm,"#Abstract

**Background**

Since the emergence of COVID-19, tens of millions of people have been infected, and the global death toll approached 1 million by September 2020. Understanding the transmission dynamics of emerging pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2 and other novel human coronaviruses is imperative in designing effective control measures. Viral load contributes to the transmission potential of the virus, but findings around the temporal viral load dynamics, particularly the peak of transmission potential, remain inconsistent across studies due to limited sample sizes. 

**Methods**

We searched PubMed through June 8th 2020 and collated unique individual-patient data (IPD) from papers reporting temporal viral load and shedding data from coronaviruses. We analyzed viral load trajectories using a series of generalized additive models, and the duration of viral shedding by fitting log-normal models accounting for interval censoring.

**Results**

We identified 115 relevant papers and obtained data from 66 (57.4%) - representing a total of 1198 patients across 14 countries. SARS-CoV-2 viral load peaks prior to symptom onset and remains elevated for up to three weeks, while MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV viral loads peak after symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV had median viral shedding durations of 4.8, 4.2, and 1.2 days after symptom onset. Disease severity, age, and specimen type all have an effect on viral load, but sex does not.

**Discussion**

Using a pooled analysis of the largest collection of IPD on viral load to date, we are the first to report that SARS-CoV-2 viral load peaks prior to -- not at -- symptom onset. Detailed estimation of the trajectories of viral load and virus shedding can inform the transmission, mathematical modeling, and clinical implications of SARS-CoV-2, MERS, and SARS infection.",1,t2_blqmw,2020-10-01 15:45:48,/r/COVID19/comments/j347zz/sarscov2_viral_load_peaks_prior_to_symptom_onset/g79lejm/,0

The haplotype is found in about 16% of the population in Europe and half the population in South Asia, while in Africa and East Asia it is non-existent. 

Zeberg and Paabo, who work at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany, noted that the prevalence of the particular Neanderthal gene group is highest in people from Bangladesh, where 63% are estimated to carry a copy of the haplotype.

They cited studies from the U.K. showing that people of Bangladeshi descent have about two times higher risk of dying from COVID-19 than the general population.”

Ok, so now they're starting to advocate the ""state of emergency permanently""-narrative? This is what I've been worrying about.

Soon papers like this will hit the mainstream and some politicians will start planning for permanent safety measures despite the vaccine being available to ""make everyone safe from covid19"". 

I'm not sure this will go down well with many people. Most people understand temporary measures to ""flatten the curve"", but not everyone wants to be ""even safer"" than before. 

This is bit of a stretch, but this ""even more safe""-ideology is exactly what is killing the nuclear industry because safe was not enough and people are irrationally afraid of any radiation in any amount. And partly because of that we have massive particle emissions. And those emissions are killing hundreds of thousands of people in the US per year. 

Are those ""right kind of deaths"" and the death from covid19 ""are wrong kind"" so they must be prevented at any cost?  

[https://www.pnas.org/content/116/18/8775](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/18/8775)

&gt; For example, Fann et al. ([**20**](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/18/8775#ref-20)) estimated **130,000 deaths from PM2.5 in 2005.** The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation ([**21**](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/18/8775#ref-21)) estimated **90,000 US deaths from PM2.5 in 2015**. In addition, Heo et al. ([**11**](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/18/8775#ref-11)) conclude that total damages in the United States are $1.0 trillion per year, similar to our estimate. 

So maybe \~1 million US citizens dead per ten years - mostly older and frailer people of course but probably also some younger people with lung or cardiovascular diseases. But these deaths have been acceptable for decades.

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j386cy,t3_j386cy,g7a590u,"EMA’s human medicines committee (CHMP) has started the first ‘rolling review’ of a COVID-19 vaccine, which is being developed by the company AstraZeneca in collaboration with the University of Oxford. 

The start of the rolling review means that the committee has started evaluating the first batch of data on the vaccine, which come from laboratory studies (non-clinical data). This does not mean that a conclusion can be reached yet on the vaccine’s safety and effectiveness, as much of the evidence is still to be submitted to the committee.

A rolling review is one of the regulatory tools that the Agency uses to speed up the assessment of a promising medicine or vaccine during a public health emergency. Normally, all data on a medicine’s effectiveness, safety and quality and all required documents must be submitted at the start of the evaluation in a formal application for marketing authorisation. In the case of a rolling review, the CHMP reviews data as they become available from ongoing studies, before deciding that sufficient data are available and that a formal application should be submitted by the company.

The CHMP’s decision to start the rolling review of the vaccine is based on preliminary results from non-clinical and early clinical studies suggesting that the vaccine triggers the production of antibodies and T cells (cells of the immune system, the body’s natural defences) that target the virus. 

Large-scale clinical trials involving several thousands of people are ongoing, and results will become available over the coming weeks and months. These results will provide information on how effective the vaccine is in protecting people against COVID-19 and will be assessed in later rolling review cycles. All the available data on the safety of the vaccine emerging from these studies, as well as data on its quality (such as its ingredients and the way it is produced), will also be reviewed.  

The rolling review will continue until enough evidence is available to support a formal marketing authorisation application. 

EMA will complete its assessment according to its usual standards for quality, safety and effectiveness. While the overall review timeline cannot be forecast yet, the process should be shorter than a regular evaluation due to the time gained during the rolling review. The rolling review process has been used previously in the assessment of the COVID-19 medicine, Veklury (remdesivir).",1,t2_dhkvi9s,2020-10-01 21:05:02,/r/COVID19/comments/j386cy/ema_starts_first_rolling_review_of_a_covid19/g7a590u/,0

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j39jwg,t3_j39jwg,g7aekhj,"&gt;**Background.** The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an ongoing global health crisis, directly and indirectly impacting all spheres of human life. Some pharmacological measures have been proposed to prevent COVID-19 or reduce its severity, such as vaccinations.   
&gt;  
&gt;Previous reports indicate that influenza vaccination appears to be negatively correlated with COVID-19-associated mortality, perhaps as a result of heterologous immunity or changes in innate immunity. The understanding of such trends in correlations could prevent deaths from COVID-19 in the future. The aim of this study was therefore to analyze the association between COVID-19 related deaths and influenza vaccination rate (IVR) in elderly people worldwide.   
&gt;  
&gt;**Methods.** To determine the association between COVID-19 deaths and influenza vaccination, available data sets from countries with more than 0.5 million inhabitants were analyzed (in total 39 countries). To accurately estimate the influence of IVR on COVID-19 deaths and mitigate effects of confounding variables, a sophisticated ranking of the importance of different variables was performed, including as predictor variables IVR and some potentially important geographical and socioeconomic variables as well as variables related to non-pharmaceutical intervention. The associations were measured by non-parametric Spearman rank correlation coefficients and random forest functions.   
&gt;  
&gt;**Results.** The results showed a positive association between COVID-19 deaths and IVR of people ≥ 65 years-old. There is a significant increase in COVID-19 deaths from eastern to western regions in the world. Further exploration is needed to explain these findings, and additional work on this line of research may lead to prevention of deaths associated with COVID-19.",1,t2_1g543a,2020-10-01 22:31:16,/r/COVID19/comments/j39jwg/positive_association_between_covid19_deaths_and/g7aekhj/,0

Reproducibility is especially important considering the amount of [inherent potential flaws](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51491763), that arise from single use of RT-PCR tests(this specific RT-PCR test was the Allplex one). The primary endpoint was to figure out whether the asymptomatic carriers held virus towards the second test point, not necessarily whether they held a similar load throughout, although that was their finding as well within the timepoints.

The problems in the cited study arise, due to there being only two measurement timepoints, those measurement timepoints are conducted via assay on the nasopharynx, including the fact, that they had homogenous groups. Main painpoint being, the fact that there was only one timepoint for the mean Ct-value analysis. Overall just not a very good assessment of viral dynamics.

**Background**

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic necessitated rapid and global responses across all areas of healthcare, including an unprecedented interest in serological immunoassays to detect antibodies to the virus. The dynamics of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is still not well understood.

**Methods**

We measure SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in plasma samples from 880 people in Northern Ireland by Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgA/IgM, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG and EuroImmun IgG SARS-CoV-2 ELISA immunoassays to analyse immune dynamics over time. Using these results, we develop a ""pseudo gold standard"" reference cohort against which to assess immunoassay performance. We report performance metrics for the UK-RTC AbC-19 rapid lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) against a characterised panel of 304 positives established using the ""pseudo gold standard"" system and 350 negative samples.

**Results**

We detect persistence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG up to 140 days (20 weeks) post infection, across all three antibody immunoassays, at levels up to 4.4 times the cut-off for a positive result by Roche measurement. Using our ""pseudo gold standard"" cohort (n=348 positive, n=510 negative) we determine the sensitivity and specificity of the three commercial immunoassays used (EuroImmun; Sens. 98.9% [97.7-99.7%]; Spec. 99.2% [98.4-99.8%]; Roche; Sens. 99.4% [98.6-100%]; Spec. (96.7% [95.1-98.2%]; Abbott; Sens. 86.8% [83.1-90.2%]; Spec. (99.2% [98.4-99.8%]). The UK-RTC AbC-19 lateral flow immunoassay using shows a sensitivity of 97.70% (95.72%-99.34%) and specificity of 100% (100.00-100.00%).

**Conclusions**

Through comprehensive analysis of a large cohort of pre-pandemic and pandemic individuals, we show detectable levels of IgG antibodies, lasting up to 140 days, providing insight to immunity levels at later time points. We propose an alternative to RT-PCR positive status as a standard for assessing SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays and show strong performance metrics for the AbC-19 rapid test.",3,t2_blqmw,2020-10-02 01:36:44,/r/COVID19/comments/j3d8pc/sarscov2_antibody_testing_in_a_uk_population/g7b3wzn/,0

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j32fug,t3_j32fug,g7b7t62,"&gt;The second mode, displacement ventilation, has vents placed at the bottom and the top of a room, creating a cooler lower zone and a warmer upper zone, and warm air is extracted through the top part of the room. As our exhaled breath is also warm, most of it accumulates in the upper zone. Provided the interface between the zones is high enough, contaminated air can be extracted by the ventilation system rather than breathed in by someone else.

Many of us are use to this type of ventilation within our homes here in the US. I found it curious that what they outlined here was the ventilation scenario we have in the summer months, where the top vent is open and the lower vent is closed. This allows the hot air that gets displaced towards the ceiling to escape as summarized in the article while fresh cool air comes in the lower vent.

During the winter months however, you are supposed to switch the vent positions so the top is closed and the lower is open. This helps to accumulate heat from the ceiling down which displaces the cold air out the lower vent. This creates a larger zone of hot air above. Along those lines would it not also pose a greater risk for accumulating the warm exhaled breath as well. The researchers noted that this would normally be pulled in the top vent. This I would theorize would add to the already greater risk of the winter months (closed windows, more time indoors, etc.) that are being highlighted.

EDIT:  I am not sure if displacement ventilation is exactly the same as the scenario I described in a home. I am referring to adjusting the return registers or vents in a home during the summer or winter.

I'm just making numbers up here, but say: 

* USA has age 65+ of 1000 deaths per 100k due to COVID and influenza vaccine rate is 50,000 per 100,000 for ages 65+.  
* Canada has age 65+ is 500 deaths per 100k due to COVID and influenza vaccine rate is 25,000 per 100,000 for ages 65+.  

That's the kind of thing presented in the study. As the flu vaccine rate goes up, the COVID death rate goes up. At the country level. So what? 

If this was done at the individual level, maybe we'd see no affect or the opposite affect? Assume both US and Canada are 100,000 people for simplicity:    

For instance, maybe the USA numbers are 500 covid deaths from the flu vaccine group (50,000 people), 500 from the non-flu vaccine group (50,000 people). That indicates flu vaccine may be totally uncorrelated with COVID in the US. 

But maybe Canada has all 500 deaths from the non-flu vaccine group (75,000 people). In Canada, it looks like no flu vaccine is a huge predictor of COVID death. Both of these scenarios fit the original country-level data and both are opposite of what the country level comparison in the paper shows. 

At the aggregate individual level, we have 500 deaths from the flu vaccine group (75,000) people and 1,500 deaths from the no-vaccine group (125,000) people. So a death rate of 667 per 100k in the flu vaccine group and 1200 per 100k in the no flu vaccine group.

There could be a lesson here for COVID-19, though in this case it would bode somewhat well for older folks since the older you are, the more likely you are to have symptoms beyond mild respiratory ones, the opposite of TB.

There could be an issue with effectiveness in the elderly just due to a decline of naive germinal center T-cells and B-cells to be recruited as long lived effector T-cells and memory B-cells. We see these good strong initial T-cell and neutralizing antibody responses in the elderly who survive infection or who have been enrolled in phase 2 trials, but we don't know if these will be as long-lasting as we expect they are in younger people, or if the people who died would have had them.

I don't know about the HPV vaccine but it seems to be still very effective (88-91%) in 26+ year olds (depending on study), just not as effective as it is in 15-26 year olds (97-100%). Edit: did some reading and the vaccines seem to elicit lower antibody titers in older populations. Also there's the simple fact that older people are more likely to have been exposed, a lot of HPV trials are done as ""intent to treat"" rather than eliminating people with evidence of prior infection, which reduces effectiveness drastically in older people (to 41% or less). HPV infections are persistent/go dormant, so the vaccine is useless if you've had it before.

However that probably won't happen. It will probably be less effective than that and likely will not induce sterilizing immunity.

&gt;There is no evidence that getting a flu vaccination increases your risk of getting sick from a coronavirus, like the one that causes COVID-19.  
&gt;  
&gt;You may have heard about a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7126676/) published in January 2020 that reported an association between flu vaccination and risk of four commonly circulating seasonal coronaviruses, but not the one that causes COVID-19. This report was later found to be incorrect.  
&gt;  
&gt;The results from that initial study led researchers in Canada to look at their data to see if they could find similar results in their population. The results from Canada’s [study](https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa626/5842161) showed that flu vaccination did not increase risk for these seasonal coronaviruses. The Canadian findings highlighted the protective benefits of flu vaccination.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Canadian researchers also identified a flaw in the methods of the first study, noting that it violated the part of study design that compares vaccination rates among patients with and without flu ([test negative design](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/effectivenessqa.htm#factors)). This flaw led to the incorrect association between flu vaccination and seasonal coronavirus risk. When these researchers reexamined data from the first study using correct methods, they found that flu vaccination did not increase risk for infection with other respiratory viruses, including seasonal coronaviruses.

In other words it could be believed that the number of exposures or even infections could be higher than the reported numbers. But the magic is hidden in that it's hard to say by what amount and how significant it actually is. Even the uncaught cases were relatively large in numbers, that by itself doesn't by itself ensure that at least some of those same persons can't get infected sometime later. Strength of immune systems can fluctuate over time, even seasonally (diet, sun, physical activity, also dry air, irritating mucous membranes) when their immune system gets weaker (such as changing seasons, dry air can cause mucous membrane irritation), making parts of the population more susceptible, allowing spreading to accelerate. But at the same time, guessing from an evolutionary perspective, it would be strange for immune systems not to adapt in such a way, that it would remember even weak encounters with invading viruses, for example I'd not be surprised, if the immune system reacted faster the next time it encountered a virus that went away without causing lasting antibody reaction.

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j3cyu1,t1_g7ba0i0,g7bpgy4,"I think it’s important to remember that every virus has a way of persisting in a population.

For influenza, it changes.  For measles, it’s insanely contagious enough to keep circulating in noninmune children.  For herpesviruses, they set up latent infections.

For at least the endemic human respiratory coronaviruses, the arrangement *appears* to be that the coronavirus infects a young child, who generates an immune response.  Young children have robust innate immune responses and fight the virus off with little difficulty.  However, the antibody response tails off after some time (and this paper suggests that this may be a property of the virus) and so that allows the virus to reinfect the host.  

The reinfection is brief and mild (often without symptoms) and then the adaptive immune response gained in young childhood kicks in and banished the virus again.  This cycle repeats every year or two and so the virus persists in the population perhaps by inducing a B cell decline after infection.  

Ok, so *how* does the virus do this?  This paper examines just the surface.

But I’m going to venture an educated guess that the spike protein itself is not the key to this immune evasion.  So that means that if we gain immunity by another method, say a spike-only vaccine, that may grant us longer-lasting antibody levels.  

That’s my hypothesis about what will happen and where vaccines will take us.",5,t2_874fg,2020-10-02 04:07:33,/r/COVID19/comments/j3cyu1/covid19_makes_b_cells_forget_but_t_cells_remember/g7bpgy4/,0

The effect they find is that while the vaccine protects one from the flu it does not do so for other respiratory viruses (except those found to be affected by the vaccine). The vaccine itself does not increase or decrease your chances of getting an hCoV or Rhinovirus infection. What does appear to reduce ones chances of getting those infections is a wild type influenza infection beforehand (which your're less likely to get after a flu shot).

With the above in mind, in regards to SARS-cov-2, there is evidence you can get it and influenza at the same time, they do not seem to interfere.

The primary purpose of this study was to compare the performance of the different assays for detecting seroprevalence, though, and indeed in the results, they state:

&gt; Our detection of antibodies 140 days after RT PCR positive status (20 weeks, and beyond in a small number of samples) indicates persistence IgG antibodies to both the spike protein and nucleocapsid protein, despite typical patterns of antibody decay after acute viral antigenic exposure being rapid. Where others have reported SARS-CoV-2 antibodies decline at 90 days, we also noted a statistically significant decline over time but levels remain detectable at 140 days (Figure 2). We note that IgG levels reach their peak as late as Week 8-12 (Roche ratio 5.45 times threshold cut-off), though this may be an artefact of lower number of participants at earlier timepoints (Figure 2d). Longitudinal studies on SARS-CoV convalescent patients suggests that 
detectable IgG can still be present as long as 2 years after infection. Further 
studies are needed on large cohorts with sequential antibody immunoassays 
performed on symptomatic and non-symptomatic individuals as well as those with mild and severe COVID-19. This is vital to inform vaccine durability,
so-called ‘immune passports’ and in the definition of a protective threshold

Global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues unabated. Binding of SARS-CoV-2’s Spike protein to host angiotensin converting enzyme 2 triggers viral entry, but other proteins may participate, including neuropilin-1 receptor (NRP-1). As both Spike protein and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) – a pro-nociceptive and angiogenic factor, bind NRP-1, we tested if Spike could block VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling. VEGF-A–triggered sensory neuronal firing was blocked by Spike protein and NRP-1 inhibitor EG00229. Pro-nociceptive behaviors of VEGF-A were similarly blocked via suppression of spontaneous spinal synaptic activity and reduction of electrogenic currents in sensory neurons. Remarkably, preventing VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling was antiallodynic in a neuropathic pain model. A ‘silencing’ of pain via subversion of VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling may underlie increased disease transmission in asymptomatic individuals.",1,t2_2udexuco,2020-10-02 04:41:48,/r/COVID19/comments/j3guf3/sarscov2_spike_protein_coopts_vegfaneuropilin1/g7bul71/,0

Although most COVID-19 cases have occurred in low-resource countries, little is known about the epidemiology of the disease in such contexts. Data from the Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh provide a detailed view into SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathways and mortality in a high-incidence setting. Reported cases and deaths have been concentrated in younger cohorts than expected from observations in higher-income countries, even after accounting for demographic differences across settings. Among 575,071 individuals exposed to 84,965 confirmed cases, infection probabilities ranged from 4.7-10.7% for low-risk and high-risk contact types. Same-age contacts were associated with the greatest infection risk. Case-fatality ratios spanned 0.05% at ages 5-17 years to 16.6% at ages ≥85 years. Primary data are urgently needed from low-resource countries to guide control measures.",1,t2_5px2592m,2020-10-02 06:58:00,/r/COVID19/comments/j3ja5b/epidemiology_and_transmission_dynamics_of_covid19/g7ca55g/,0

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j3ja5b,t3_j3ja5b,g7cazv1,"This study has used one of the largest (most likely the largest) contact tracing dataset.

&gt; The mean number of contacts tested per index case was 7.3 (interquartile range: 2-9) and 0.2% of index cases were linked to &gt;80 tested contacts (range: 1-857; Fig. 2A); numbers of contacts tested varied by district, and the geographic distribution of index cases included in our analyses did not necessarily reflect the geographic distribution of all reported cases (table S5).

&gt; **No positive contacts were identified for 70.7% of index cases** for whom reliable contact-tracing data, including test results, were available (Fig. 2A).

####Secondary attack rates 

&gt; Assuming test-positive contacts were infected by the index case to whom they were traced, we estimated that the overall secondary attack rate (or risk of transmission from an index case to an exposed contact) was 10.7% (10.5-10.9%) for high-risk contacts, who had close social contact or direct physical contact with index cases without protective measures, and 4.7% (4.6-4.8%) for low-risk contacts, who were in the proximity of index cases but did not meet these criteria for high-risk exposure (tables S6 and S7).

&gt; Secondary attack rate estimates ranged from 1.2% (0.0-5.1%) in healthcare settings to 2.6% (1.6-3.9%) in the community and 9.0% (7.5-10.5%) in the household.

&gt; Among 78 individuals with high-risk travel exposures—defined as close proximity to an infected individual in a shared conveyance for ≥6 hours—we estimated a secondary attack rate of 79.3% (52.9-97.0%).",1,t2_5px2592m,2020-10-02 07:05:04,/r/COVID19/comments/j3ja5b/epidemiology_and_transmission_dynamics_of_covid19/g7cazv1/,0

I'm simply raising a concern I had. Just looking around at reality and seeing how irresponsibly people are behaving irl makes me wonder if this too will be misused. A qualified facility such as a Walgreens could be a good solution. A festival or airplane would also be ideal since they have an interest in refusing entry to anyone ill, however seeing schools and offices right now trying to cover up and hide covid cases makes me wonder if they were given even more control to over testing if that would be abused. I could see how pressure from parents to allow schools to stay open could lead to local outbreaks to be unreported. The fact is it already happens, and might just happen more. It might not be an entirely bad thing either as long as sick people are still identified quickly and respect the guidelines to isolate. I think a certified testing station might be a good compromise.

Masks and mitigation will have to remain  vital  tools moving forward. Getting people to do and understand that will be tough. Hopefully I'm wrong, but pandemic fatigue is gaining fast....

Hopefully JJ will prove efficient enough. One dose, just refrigeration, etc. Would make logistics and distribution so much easier/faster.

The DoD study found no overall increase in non-flu infection after vaccine receipt. Two popped significantly when you break down by category, though previous studies found the opposite (ones which prompted this study), indicating this is likely noise. They say as much in the conclusion. Edit: As this is a test negative design, and we only see sick people, this is essentially saying: if you remove flu from the equation, are sick people more likely to be sick with something other than flu? Yes. Any specific increases, or all across the board? Well, some are up in contrast to other studies, and some are down in contrast to other studies, hence it looks like noise.

The second is about a small cohort kids in one flu season, which is a horrible example of general vaccine interference (the study is fine however, just not generalizable). Moreover as kids are far more likely to get sick in general, hence we're most likely looking at a substitution effect. Meaning, they're protected from flu, hence more likely to get something else. This is actually evident in the DoD paper you linked first which found higher rates of household infection (regardless of agent) in those with children, high enough such that direct comparison without weighting is wrong.",2,t2_oee3a,2020-10-02 09:23:57,/r/COVID19/comments/j39jwg/positive_association_between_covid19_deaths_and/g7cqc2s/,0

2. Infection probabilities ranged from 4.7-10.7% for low-risk and high-risk contact types, respectively. **Same-age contacts were associated with the greatest infection risk.**

3. The study found high prevalence of infection among children who were contacts of cases around their own age; this finding of enhanced infection risk among individuals exposed to similar-age cases was also apparent among adults.

4. Not all infected individual transmit COVID-19.

Abstract
&gt;Global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues unabated. Binding of SARS-CoV-2’s Spike protein to host angiotensin converting enzyme 2 triggers viral entry, but other proteins may participate, including neuropilin-1 receptor (NRP-1). As both Spike protein and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) – a pro-nociceptive and angiogenic factor, bind NRP-1, we tested if Spike could block VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling. VEGF-A–triggered sensory neuronal firing was blocked by Spike protein and NRP-1 inhibitor EG00229. Pro-nociceptive behaviors of VEGF-A were similarly blocked via suppression of spontaneous spinal synaptic activity and reduction of electrogenic currents in sensory neurons. Remarkably, preventing VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling was antiallodynic in a neuropathic pain model. A ‘silencing’ of pain via subversion of VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling may underlie increased disease transmission in asymptomatic individuals.

What's the *actual* evidence for decreased pain?

* First they show that pure spike protein inhibits VEGF-A and suppresses neuronal firing mediated by VEGF-A when applied to some neurons ex vivo.

* Then they show that injecting spike protein into rats reduced (but did not completely inhibit) VEGF-A-induced pain tolerance reductions in live animals. Spike did nothing to pain perception on its own - they had to also inject VEGF-A first.

* The rest of their paper delves into the mechanisms of how spike actually alters VEGF-A signalling.

Quite a leap to go from ""purified spike protein injected into rats decreases neuropathic pain in a specific model when they also get injections of a pro-pain protein"" to ""SARS-CoV-2 decreases pain in humans"", let alone ""SARS-CoV-2 decreases pain in humans and this drives asymptomatic spread"".

Any statements about the role of SARS-CoV-2 in reducing pain in humans and downstream effects on population are completely speculative and (in my opinion) rather unscientific given the number of massive assumptions at play. Still, I've worked with academic press departments before and they'll never miss an opportunity to overreach.",3,t2_84pge,2020-10-02 17:37:10,/r/COVID19/comments/j3p30z/pain_relief_caused_by_sarscov2_infection_may_help/g7dw5m6/,0

Darmstadt based R-Biopharm AG is the first German diagnostics company to launch a SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid test. With a 95% diagnostic sensitivity and 100% diagnostic specificity, the test is one of the most reliable on the market, the company stated. The performance results are confirmed by independent laboratories and universities. 
 
The test is a manual immunochromatographic lateral flow assay for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific antigens in human respiratory specimens from individuals with reasonable suspicion and/or symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. It provides a rapid diagnostic tool for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infection in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory findings.
 
Use for professional users
 
The product is currently intended for use by specialist users in hospital laboratories, reference laboratories, private laboratories or government laboratories, as well as by medical personnel in health authorities, retirement homes and doctors' practices. The RIDA®QUICK SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Test will be available from mid October. 
 
Test is easy to perform

&gt;Global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues unabated. Binding of SARS-CoV-2’s Spike protein to host angiotensin converting enzyme 2 triggers viral entry, but other proteins may participate, including neuropilin-1 receptor (NRP-1). 

&gt;As both Spike protein and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) – a pro-nociceptive and angiogenic factor, bind NRP-1, we tested if Spike could block VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling. VEGF-A–triggered sensory neuronal firing was blocked by Spike protein and NRP-1 inhibitor EG00229. Pro-nociceptive behaviors of VEGF-A were similarly blocked via suppression of spontaneous spinal synaptic activity and reduction of electrogenic currents in sensory neurons. 

&gt;Remarkably, preventing VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling was antiallodynic in a neuropathic pain model. A ‘silencing’ of pain via subversion of VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling may underlie increased disease transmission in asymptomatic individuals.",1,t2_2oyey9pr,2020-10-02 20:24:10,/r/COVID19/comments/j3tho5/sarscov2_the_virus_that_causes_covid19_can/g7e8fzi/,0

Let's take a common doctors office visiting hours, because recently, Germany for example has said that they're thinking of running vaccination centers (Drive-in style) and distribution at the family doc in parallel. So a regular family doc is open from like 9AM to 6PM (Yes, they're somewhat lazy) add in a break from 12-1PM and we're at 8 hours of opening time. A regular family doc has at least one assistant who is, at least in Germany, also trained in administering injections. If we say one vaccine administration takes 60 seconds from sitting down the first to sitting down the next patient, one of them could administer 480 doses a day, both of them 960. Let's just assume it takes a bit more time for some, sometimes you need to go to the loo, grab a drink or a bite to eat and one of them can administer 400 vaccines per shift, since this is quite the emergency and they know how important getting the vaccine out is, if the supply is there, the injections are the smallest thing. Even if we say it takes 110 days to get it to everyone, we can subtract a few days because not everyone will actually want it, and 110 days to vaccinate a country is pretty damn quick in my book.",1,t2_s6x1h,2020-10-02 20:25:47,/r/COVID19/comments/j3dbcx/jj_vaccine_data/g7e8lc3/,0

&gt;The basic reproduction number R0
of the coronavirus disease 2019 has been estimated to range between 2 and 4. Here, we used an SEIR model that properly accounts for the distribution of the latent period and, based on empirical estimates of the doubling time in the near-exponential phases of epidemic progression in China, Italy, Spain, France, UK, Germany, Switzerland and New York State, we estimated that R0 lies in the range 4.7–11.4. We explained this discrepancy by performing stochastic simulations of model dynamics in a population with a small proportion of super-spreaders. The simulations revealed two-phase dynamics, in which an initial phase of relatively slow epidemic progression diverts to a faster phase upon appearance of infectious super-spreaders. Early estimates obtained for this initial phase may suggest lower R0.",1,t2_cj5j6,2020-10-02 21:21:21,/r/COVID19/comments/j3ubow/superspreading_events_initiated_the_exponential/g7edyan/,0

""SIX TRIGGER CRITERIA FOR STATE COVID-19 VACCINATION MANDATES.

Covid-19 is not adequately contained in the state.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has recommended vaccination for the groups for which a mandate is being considered.

The supply of vaccine is sufficient to cover the population groups for which a mandate is being considered.

Available evidence about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine has been transparently communicated.

The state has created infrastructure to provide access to vaccination without financial or logistic barriers, compensation to workers who have adverse effects from a required vaccine, and real-time surveillance of vaccine side effects.

In a time-limited evaluation, voluntary uptake of the vaccine among high-priority groups has fallen short of the level required to prevent epidemic spread.""

The only difference between COVID and colds or flus here (assuming you don't actually have a nervous system infection) might be the degree of inflammation, since this is a novel virus and the immune response is going to be a bit different from a virus you've had before.

It's not a reliable predictor of whether you have SARS-CoV-2 or some other respiratory virus because they can all cause it.

**Objectives**

The four seasonal coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 are frequent causes of respiratory infections and show annual and seasonal variation. Increased understanding about these patterns could be informative about the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. 

**Methods**

Results from PCR diagnostics for the seasonal coronaviruses, and other respiratory viruses, were obtained for 55,190 clinical samples analyzed at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, between 14 September 2009 and 2 April 2020. 

**Results**

Seasonal coronaviruses were detected in 2,130 samples (3.9%). OC43 was most commonly detected (28.4% of detections), followed by NL63 (24.0%), HKU1 (17.6%), and 229E (15.3%). The overall fraction of positive samples was relatively similar between seasons. In contrast, at species level there was distinct pattern of biennial alternating peak seasons for the Alphacoronaviruses, 229E and NL63, and the Betacoronaviruses, OC43 and HKU1, respectively. The Betacoronaviruses peaked earlier in the winter season (Dec-Jan) than the Alphacoronaviruses (Feb-Mar). Coronaviruses were detected across all ages, but diagnostics were more frequently requested for paediatric patients than adults and the elderly. The species showed different age distributions, with OC43 and 229E positivity being relatively constant across age strata, while the incidence of NL63 and HKU1 decreased with age.

**Conclusions**

Both the Alphacoronaviruses and Betacoronaviruses showed alternating biennial winter incidence peaks, which suggests some type of immune mediated interaction. Symptomatic reinfections in adults and the elderly appear relatively common. Both findings may be of relevance for the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.",2,t2_blqmw,2020-10-03 03:03:42,/r/COVID19/comments/j40q3m/interactions_between_seasonal_human_coronaviruses/g7firr2/,0

**Background**

REACT-1 is a community survey of PCR confirmed swab-positivity for SARS-CoV-2 among random samples of the population in England. This interim report includes data from the fifth round of data collection currently underway for swabs sampled from the 18th to 26th September 2020.

**Methods**

Repeated cross-sectional surveys of random samples of the population aged 5 years and over in England with sample size ranging from 120,000 to 160,000 people in each round of data collection. Collection of self-administered nose and throat swab for PCR and questionnaire data. Prevalence of swab-positivity by round and by demographic variables including age, sex, region, ethnicity. Estimation of reproduction number (R) between and within rounds, and time trends using exponential growth or decay model. Assessment of geographical clustering based on boundary-free spatial model.

**Results**

Over the 9 days for which data are available, we find 363 positives from 84,610 samples giving a weighted prevalence to date of 0.55% (0.47%, 0.64%) in round 5. This implies that 411,000 (351,000, 478,000) people in England are virus-positive under the assumption that the swab assay is 75% sensitive. Using data from the most recent two rounds, we estimate a doubling time of 10.6 (9.4, 12.0) days covering the period 20th August to 26th September, corresponding to a reproduction number R of 1.47 (1.40, 1.53). Using data only from round 5 we estimate a reproduction number of 1.06 (0.74, 1.46) with probability of 63% that R is greater than 1. Between rounds 4 and 5 there was a marked increase in unweighted prevalence at all ages. In the most recent data, prevalence was highest in the 18 to 24 yrs age group at 0.96% (0.68%, 1.36%). At 65+ yrs prevalence increased ~7-fold between rounds 4 and 5 from 0.04% (0.03%, 0.07%) to 0.29% (0.23%, 0.37%). Prevalence increased in all regions between rounds 4 and 5, giving the highest unweighted prevalence in round 5 in the North West at 0.86% (0.69%, 1.06%). In London, prevalence increased ~5-fold from 0.10% (0.06%, 0.17%) to 0.49% (0.36%, 0.68%). Regional R values ranged from 1.32 (1.16,1.50) in Yorkshire and the Humber to 1.63 (1.42, 1.88) in the East Midlands over the same period. In the most recent data, there was extensive clustering in the North West, Midlands and in and around London with pockets of clustering in other regions including the South West, North East and East of England. Odds of swab-positivity were ~2-fold higher in people of Asian and Black ethnicity compared with white participants.

**Conclusion**

Rapid growth has led to high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in England among all regions and age groups, including those age groups at highest risk. Although there is evidence of a recent deceleration in the epidemic, current levels of prevalence will inevitably result in additional hospitalisations and mortality in coming weeks. A re-doubling of public health efforts is needed to return to a declining phase of the epidemic.",1,t2_blqmw,2020-10-03 03:05:34,/r/COVID19/comments/j40rgn/high_prevalence_of_sarscov2_swab_positivity_in/g7fj138/,0

Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) transmits by droplets generated from surfaces of airway mucus during processes of respiration within hosts infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. We studied respiratory droplet generation and exhalation in human and nonhuman primate subjects with and without COVID-19 infection to explore whether SARS-CoV-2 infection, and other changes in physiological state, translates into observable evolution of numbers and sizes of exhaled respiratory droplets in healthy and diseased subjects. In our observational cohort study of the exhaled breath particles of 74 healthy human subjects, and in our experimental infection study of eight nonhuman primates infected by aerosol with SARS-CoV-2, we found that exhaled aerosol particles increase one to three orders of magnitude with aging, high BMI, and COVID-19 infection. These variances appear to be related to changes in airway mucus surface composition and the propensity for mucus surfaces to breakup into small droplets during acts of breathing. We also observed that 20% of those participating in our human study accounted for 80% of the overall exhaled bioaerosol, reflecting a bioaerosol distribution analogous to a classical 20:80 super spreader distribution.",2,t2_blqmw,2020-10-03 03:08:14,/r/COVID19/comments/j40ton/exhaled_aerosol_increases_with_covid19_infection/g7fjf5w/,0

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j40uq9,t3_j40uq9,g7fjqkx,"**Abstract**

**Background**

In 2010-2011, we conducted a social contact survey in Flanders, Belgium, aimed at improving and extending the design of the first social contact survey conducted in Belgium in 2006. This second social contact survey aimed to enable, for the first time, the estimation of social mixing patterns for an age range of 0 to 99 years and the investigation of whether contact rates remain stable over this 5-year time period.

**Methods**

Different data mining techniques are used to explore the data, and the age-specific number of social contacts and the age-specific contact rates are modelled using a GAMLSS model. We compare different matrices using assortativeness measures. The relative change in the basic reproduction number (R0) and the ratio of relative incidences with 95% bootstrap confidence intervals (BCI) are employed to investigate and quantify the impact on epidemic spread due to differences in gender, day of the week, holiday vs. regular periods and changes in mixing patterns over the 5-year time gap between the 2006 and 2010-2011 surveys. Finally, we compare the fit of the contact matrices in 2006 and 2010-2011 to Varicella serological data.

**Results**

All estimated contact patterns featured strong homophily in age and gender, especially for small children and adolescents. A 30% (95% BCI [17%; 37%]) and 29% (95% BCI [14%; 40%]) reduction in R0 was observed for weekend versus weekdays and for holiday versus regular periods, respectively. Significantly more interactions between people aged 60+ years and their grandchildren were observed on holiday and weekend days than on regular weekdays. Comparing contact patterns using different methods did not show any substantial differences over the 5-year time period under study.

**Conclusions**

The second social contact survey in Flanders, Belgium, endorses the findings of its 2006 predecessor and adds important information on the social mixing patterns of people older than 60 years of age. Based on this analysis, the mixing patterns of people older than 60 years exhibit considerable heterogeneity, and overall, the comparison of the two surveys shows that social contact rates can be assumed stable in Flanders over a time span of 5 years.",1,t2_blqmw,2020-10-03 03:10:12,/r/COVID19/comments/j40uq9/close_contact_infection_dynamics_over_time/g7fjqkx/,0

I wonder,  though, if a feedback loop is possible when the odds of coming into contact with multiple infected people become significant.

If the cutoff for infection is 1,000 virus particles,  and you come into contact with multiple people who shed 500 particles each on you,  then a person who by themselves would not be contagious can end up infecting many.

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j42ss8,t3_j42ss8,g7g0xct,"An antibody cocktail against SARS-CoV-2

There is an urgent focus on antibodies that target the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral spike and prevent the virus from entering host cells. Hansen et al. generated a large panel of antibodies against the spike protein from humanized mice and recovered patients. From this panel, they identified several neutralizing antibodies, including pairs that do not compete for binding to the receptor binding domain. Baum et al. focused in on four of these antibodies. All four are effective against known spike variants. However, by growing a pseudovirus that expresses the spike in the presence of individual antibodies, the authors were able to select for spike mutants resistant to that antibody. In contrast, escape mutants are not selected when pseudovirus is grown in the presence of pairs of antibodies that either do not compete or only partially compete for binding to the RBD.

**Introduction**

Healthcare workers are believed to be at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The extent of that increased risk compared to the general population and the groups most at risk have not been extensively studied.

**Methods**

A prospective observational study of health and social care workers in NHS Tayside (Scotland, UK) from May to September 2020. The Siemens SARS-CoV-2 total antibody assay was used to establish seroprevalence in this cohort. Patients provided clinical information including demographics and workplace information. Controls, matched for age and sex to the general Tayside population, were studied for comparison.

**Results**

A total of 2062 health and social care workers were recruited for this study. The participants were predominantly female (81.7%) and 95.2% were white. 299 healthcare workers had a positive antibody test (14.5%). 11 out of 231 control sera tested positive (4.8%). Healthcare workers therefore had an increased likelihood of a positive test (odds ratio 3.4 95% CI 1.85-6.16, p&lt;0.0001). Dentists, healthcare assistants and porters were the job roles most likely to test positive. Those working in front-line roles with COVID-19 patients were more likely to test positive (17.4% vs. 13.4%, p=0.02). 97.1% of patients who had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR had positive antibodies, compared to 11.8% of individuals with a symptomatic illness who had tested negative. Anosmia was the symptom most associated with the presence of detectable antibodies.

**Conclusion**

In this study, healthcare workers were three times more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 than the general population. The seroprevalence data in different populations identified in this study will be useful to protect healthcare staff during future waves of the pandemic.",1,t2_blqmw,2020-10-03 05:20:08,/r/COVID19/comments/j43952/seroprevalence_of_sarscov2_antibodies_in_scottish/g7g550h/,0

Mouth breathing also bypasses nitric oxide from the nose, which has been shown to kill coronaviruses in past pandemics, as well as to increase oxygen uptake in the lungs up to 20%.”

&gt;

No. Herd immunity through infections isn't a strategy and the fact any politicians are still acting like it ever was is egregiously reckless. There is absolutely no reason to believe infecting as many children as possible with a novel virus that we barely understand is a good idea. At least not from a scientific standpoint. 

The idea behind opening schools was that because most children are asymptomatic they may have low enough viral loads to not be as contagious as adults. Now that we're learning that theory was wrong, we have to find better ways to eliminate spread in schools or shut them down again. It's easy to say ""just let them catch it and eliminate spread to their families,"" but that's not possible outside of keeping the kids in a bubble separated from their families. 

&gt;What is the public health benefit of slowing the spread among the lowest risk strata (and thus lengthening the overall course of the virus)?  
&gt;

The public health benefit of saving people's lives? I think you're misunderstanding the epidemiology of pandemics. There's no ""finish line"" where once we reach a certain amount of infections the Pandemic just dissapears. Seroprevalence in America is currently estimated just below 10%. Not only is here immunity a ridiculous strategy, it's not possible. Not only that, but would require the 70-90% of Americans required to reach it to actually be cool with being infected. This virus is going to keep circulating and disrupting our lives until WE stop it.

UK scientists begin study of how long Covid can survive in the air

“It is the question scientists around the world are trying to answer: how long can the coronavirus survive in the tiny aerosol particles we exhale? In a high-security lab near Bristol, entered through a series of airlock doors, scientists may be weeks from finding out.

On Monday, they will start launching tiny droplets of live Sars-CoV-2 and levitating them between two electric rings to test how long the airborne virus remains infectious under different environmental conditions.

“It is a very important question,” said Prof Denis Doorly, an expert in fluid mechanics at Imperial College London, who is not involved in the research. “There is now huge interest in what it could take to mitigate the risk of infection in enclosed spaces, in terms of enhanced natural ventilation, or air-scrubbing systems, or UV-C lighting – but this all depends on knowing how much viable virus remains suspended in the air.”",1,t2_m1ebc,2020-10-03 21:59:51,/r/COVID19/comments/ixncry/nasopharyngeal_sarscov2_viral_loads_in_young/g7iikf6/,0

Let’s say they get 1% of total 2020 production, and Canada gets 4M doses. That should be more than enough for all HCWs and those over 80. I think it would take 14M doses for everyone above 65 in the country, so if Pfizer and Moderna can shift Canada 7M doses each by January 2021 we could see everyone over 65 who is WILLING to get a vaccine, vaccinated by February or so. 

Then through 2021 as the rest of the doses come in, the rest of the willing population takes a vaccine. The key is just getting that 65+ age group vaccinated, and all of the sudden the worries of healthcare system collapse start to subside. I’m willing to bet July 2021 is a solid target for a general return to some form of normalcy in Canada, since a majority of the population here lives in a select few metro areas where distribution shouldn’t be an absurd challenge.

Did they repeat the same experiments that halted SARS vaccines yet?


&gt; To evaluate the efficacy of existing vaccines against infection with SHC014-MA15, we vaccinated aged mice with double-inactivated whole SARS-CoV (DIV). Previous work showed that DIV could neutralize and protect young mice from challenge with a homologous virus14; however, the vaccine failed to protect aged animals in which augmented immune pathology was also observed, indicating the possibility of the animals being harmed because of the vaccination15. Here we found that DIV did not provide protection from challenge with SHC014-MA15 with regards to weight loss or viral titer (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). Consistent with a previous report with other heterologous group 2b CoVs15, serum from DIV-vaccinated, aged mice also failed to neutralize SHC014-MA15 (Supplementary Fig. 5c). Notably, DIV vaccination resulted in robust immune pathology (Supplementary Table 4) and eosinophilia (Supplementary Fig. 5d–f). Together, these results confirm that the DIV vaccine would not be protective against infection with SHC014 and could possibly augment disease in the aged vaccinated group.

&gt; We found that higher concentrations of anti-sera against SARS-CoV neutralized SARS-CoV infection, while highly diluted anti-sera significantly increased SARS-CoV infection and induced higher levels of apoptosis. Results from infectivity assays indicate that SARS-CoV ADE is primarily mediated by diluted antibodies against envelope spike proteins rather than nucleocapsid proteins. We also generated monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV spike proteins and observed that most of them promoted SARS-CoV infection. Combined, our results suggest that antibodies against SARS-CoV spike proteins may trigger ADE effects. The data raise new questions regarding a potential SARS-CoV vaccine, while shedding light on mechanisms involved in SARS pathogenesis.

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j3vly1,t1_g7if7a4,g7j4oyu,"&gt; No. Herd immunity through infections isn't a strategy and the fact any politicians are still acting like it ever was is egregiously reckless. 

Politicians?  Whom exactly?

The strategy isn't ""herd immunity through infections"", it's vertical risk stratification wherein the virus is allowed to run an acute course through low-risk populations and as flat a course as possible through high-risk populations.

Not only is it a strategy which you can read about nearly endlessly by simply searching ""risk stratification virus"" on Google Scholar, but it's what basically all of the world's best experts (Ioannidis, Osterholm, Sunetra Gupta, David Katz, and many more) have advocated.

&gt; The idea behind opening schools was that because most children are asymptomatic they may have low enough viral loads to not be as contagious as adults. 

I don't even know what this means.  Many experts (including all of those I've mentioned above) advocated against closing schools in the fist place.  Sweden did not close primary schools at all, and there is now no hope remaining that the population-level mortality in the USA will end up being lower than Sweden's.

&gt; Now that we're learning that theory was incorrect

This is, at best, controversial.  There has been no widespread observed spread from children to older family members in any of the contact tracing studies.  This paper relies on trend data, not contact tracing.  And trend data is important, but let's not pretend it's dispositive.

&gt; It's easy to say ""just let them catch it and eliminate spread to their families,"" but how?

By not sending them home in the first place!  David Katz opined in the New York Times, before college dorms closed, against their closure for *exactly this reason*, remember?

&gt; There's no ""finish line"" where once we reach a certain amount of infections the Pandemic just dissapears. 

Phew, a lot to unpack here.

You seem to be confused about the different between a pandemic and a virus.  The pandemic will end.  The virus will not.  There will come a time when enough people, either from native (eg T-cell) resistance or from antibodies, cannot be infected that the newly introduced carriers in a given population cannot cause an uptick in infections.  This, by definition, will be the end of the pandemic.

The virus, on the other hand, will continue to find little pockets in which to exist, perhaps forever.  There is no SARS-1 or polio pandemic today, but those viruses still exist.  Of the many thousands of viruses that have made their way around the world, only one has been materially eliminated.

&gt; Seroprevalence in America is currently estimated just below 10%. 

Nice use of the passive voice.

Who exactly is estimating seroprevalence at 10% in October of 2020?  Even the recent Lancet study (to which I think you might be implicitly referring) estimated around seroprevalence *in July*.  Surely it's higher now.

David Katz, who has gotten basically every extrapolation of every detail since the Diamond Princess correct, estimates that at least 70 million Americans have contracted the virus.

&gt; Not only is herd immunity a ridiculous strategy, it's simply not possible. 

Again, I'm a little lost here.  Herd immunity is the only way for the pandemic to end. Do you simply mean to suggest that herd immunity isn't possible without vaccination?  Are you wanting to rehash Bergstrom's NYT piece?  Because I thought that left a lot to be desired (though I generally love the guy).

&gt; Plus, if it were possible, it would require the 70-90% of Americans needed to reach it to actually be cool with being infected.

First of all, there is ongoing debate among experts about the immunity threshold.  But let's say 70% for the moment, fine.  Your logic is flawed in any case: nobody is saying that 70% *need to be infected*, only that 70% *need to be immune*.  Many have innate immunity, remember?  Perhaps around 50% *of the total population* (and seemingly higher in parts of Asia where SARS-1 spread).

If that's true - and most of the evidence suggests that it is - than we only need about 20-25% more to be infected.  And it's possible that we're very close at this point.

And even if we weren't, we have much more than 25% of the population from whom an infection does not represent a serious threat of death.  You don't think that there are 25% of us who will happily live amidst an acute spread in order to save our older relatives?  Of course there are.

The bottom line is this: the strategies to slow the spread (especially lockdowns, which have been unambiguously deadly) have been wrongheaded, and the experts who have questioned them - most of whom are the same experts that reddit was fascinated with during the ebola event in 2014 (when I got my start in epidemiology study) - are looking more and more reliable and correct by the day.  

The fact that easing contact restrictions brings more cases is a surprise to no serious scientist (though apparently it is to the CDC, if this paper is representative). The tuning knobs available to us at this moment are regarding in which strata those cases appear.  We need to be using those knobs.

It appears though that the focus of the study is counting the number of droplets (caught on high resolution video) emitted during speech and that certain consonants generate more droplets from lips than others e.g. more droplets are visualised with ""p"" than ""m"".

The limitation is that the particles generated from lips (from consonant enunciation) form only part of the spectrum of emission from speech. Emission from **vowels** creates much finer particles that cannot be visualised, are more widely dispersed and more readily inhaled. The origin of vowel emission is the **lower respiratory tract** (larynx to lungs) and the number of particles increases with amplitude. The emitted particle distribution curve peaks at a particle size just above 1um. This is nicely demonstrated here [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-38808-z](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-38808-z) .

Looking for a 3rd correlating variable known to cause the others is standard procedure in research methodology for evaluating whether the relationship between two correlating variables is a causal one.

The example I see most often is ice cream sales and murders. They tend to increase and decrease together.

* Should one conclude that increased ice cream consumption leads to greater likelihood of murder?

* Should one conclude that murdering leads to eating more ice cream?

* Or should one look at other correlating variables to both, note that temperature also increases with them, and recognize that there's a lot more theory/evidence suggesting that uncomfortably hot temperatures are much likelier to be a root cause to both?

* For all we know, the murderers are the ones who did NOT get ice cream when hot. We would need more information connecting them than community trends.

So this is the same kind of thing as the correlation with smell loss and deaths.

* Community increase in smell loss searches timed to increased deaths does not mean that those who did the searches are also the ones who died. They may very well be the survivors as you thought.

* We do have reason to believe both an increase in smell loss searches and an increase in COVID-19 deaths would be caused by an increase in number of infections.

We would need more data supporting a relationship at the individual-level to conclude more was going on between smell loss and deaths than the common cause of increased community infections.

- Systemic and operational issues: In Ontario, some of the functions of regional-level health boards were being merged into a centralized provincial authority, and this transition was in progress when the pandemic hit - so in many places, it was unclear who had responsibility for public health. BC had a clearer system and chain of command

- Speed of the response: A number of public-health measures taken to prevent staff from being a vector introducing the virus into care homes (e.g. increasing pay so staff didn't need to work in multiple homes to make ends meet), were taken several weeks earlier in BC compared with Ontario

- 63% of residents in LTC in BC were in individual rooms, vs. just 24% in Ontario - so better distancing within the LTC home",1,t2_gqul0,2020-10-04 05:27:42,/r/COVID19/comments/j4lbwf/covid19_in_longterm_care_homes_in_ontario_and/g7k6a97/,0

It's certainly a good thing if we can make more people immune without harm. This strategy of quarantine the high risk people has been mentioned a lot. Overall seems pretty reasonable.

However, I do not have enough information to comfortably conclude whether someone who has a mild COVID-19 infection with loss of smell is more likely to die in the near future from any cause than someone who is not infected at all.

* Offhand, I don't recall mortality rates for cases with loss of smell beyond that they suspect it's an indicator of a mild infection. If this risk remains substantial, then yea, your point stands. If not, however, we need to consider lifestyle changes for the duration of their illness.

* Someone who is infected would be expected to quarantine in relative isolation until their infection ends. Therefore, they would (hopefully) be engaging in less driving and exposure to other potentially lethal activities than someone who is not infected and still living life as usual.

* However, I don't know what the baseline risk of death was before the pandemic, and I definitely don't know what that would be now given the lifestyle changes that came with the pandemic.

After 13 weeks of hospitalization, administration of lenzilumab resulted in rapid improvement in oxygenation and subsequent discharge


Burlingame, CA, October 2, 2020 – Humanigen, Inc., (Nasdaq: HGEN) (“Humanigen”), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on preventing and treating an immune hyper-response called ‘cytokine storm,’ today announced that a patient case report on the use of lenzilumab™ in critical COVID-19 was published online at OSF Preprints. The case report, titled “COVID-19 associated chronic ARDS successfully treated with lenzilumab” is available at: https://osf.io/xusr9/.


The published case describes a 77-year-old Caucasian male patient with a past medical history of type II diabetes, coronary artery disease with coronary artery bypass graft, systolic heart failure, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with emphysema and obstructive sleep apnea. The patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and was admitted to the ICU in March 2020 for COVID-19 and put on respiratory isolation. The patient was treated with steroids, broad spectrum antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia and bronchodilators for possible COPD exacerbation and hydroxychloroquine with zinc. The patient continued to deteriorate for the next 12 weeks with an increase in oxygen demand from continuous low-flow oxygen to high-flow and eventually intermittent bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) and developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during that time.


At week 13 of hospitalization and multiple unsuccessful attempts at oxygen weaning, an emergency single use IND for lenzilumab, Humanigen’s Humaneered® anti-human granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) monoclonal antibody drug candidate, was approved by the FDA and administered to the patient. Seven days following the administration of lenzilumab, the patient’s oxygen decreased from high-flow to low-flow nasal cannula and the patient was able to walk outside of his hospital room with physical therapy. Sixteen days post-treatment with lenzilumab, the patient was discharged from the hospital on home oxygen.


A separate case-control study of lenzilumab in severe and critical COVID-19 published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings demonstrated an 80% reduction in relative risk of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and/or death for patients treated with lenzilumab compared to the matched control group. Lenzilumab is being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 3 trial and trial site locations can be found here: https://www.humanigen.com/covid-19-sites.


“The recent case-control study published by the Mayo Clinic suggests lenzilumab may improve clinical outcomes, oxygenation requirements, and improve lymphocyte counts in patients with severe and critical COVID-19 during the acute hyperinflammatory immune response,” said Juan Pulido, MD, Pulmonologist, Baptist Health Research Institute. “This patient case report suggests that lenzilumab may be beneficial to patients who are unable to wean off of supplemental oxygen and even those who have failed multiple rounds of prior therapy and are outside the initial acute hyper-inflammatory window.”


“This patient case underscores our urgency to continue our development program for lenzilumab in an effort to deliver a therapeutic that may potentially improve outcomes for hospitalized COVID-19 patients,” said Cameron Durrant, MD, MBA, chief executive officer of Humanigen. More details on Humanigen’s programs in COVID-19 can be found on the company’s website at www.humanigen.com under the COVID-19 tab, and details of the US Phase 3 potential registration study can be found at clinicaltrials.gov using Identifier NCT04351152.",1,t2_4tmsh269,2020-10-04 10:11:21,/r/COVID19/comments/j4rafl/humanigen_announces_covid19_case_report/g7lkb5m/,0

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j3vly1,t1_g7kvxh4,g7lmpk0,"&gt; I'm gonna need a source on Osterholm and Gupta advocating this strategy because I'm positive neither one of them has ever suggested anything of the sort.

### Osterholm

Mike Osterholm has an unbroken record, since the early international spread of SARS-CoV-2, of advocating that people at low risk continue to work, go to school, and run society while sheltering high-risk people.  That has always been his position, consistent, backed by evidence, and spoken with integrity.  In fact, look at any interview he has done (on respiratory diseases; he sings a different tune with CWD - a topic on which he is one of the world's foremost experts and another area where our politicians are ignoring him, perhaps to our great medium-term detriment).

Just to pull a couple examples out for you, [here's his opinion piece in WaPo](Facing covid-19 reality: A national lockdown is no cure), published in March:

&gt; The best alternative will probably  entail letting those at low risk for serious disease continue to work, keep business and manufacturing operating, and “run” society, while at  the same time advising higher-risk individuals to protect themselves  through physical distancing and ramping up our health-care capacity as  aggressively as possible. With this battle plan, we could gradually  build up immunity without destroying the financial structure on which  our lives are based.

Here he is during [an interview with Joe Rogan](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/xtgHQwo9KvEX8Cc4GZHyBto1HGEmgJTg-BpHtnPf9quxeUCnrFSSNt4ZOs3f6hPYl0aJntAZwP592ZQZ1TmNRmZFRec?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&amp;ts=646.09) (the whole thing is totally worth a watch, opinions of Rogan notwithstanding):

&gt; So do we close schools or not if we’re not really spreading the disease? Because it turns out that if we close schools, a recent study done showed that 38% of nurses today in this country who are working in the medical care area have kids in school, and if suddenly we’re closing schools for two or three months, who’s going to take care of those kids? One fourth of the American population has no sick leave. If we close schools, they don’t get paid if they have to stay home. So when you ask what can we do it, we have to really be thoughtful about what we do. Are we doing more harm than good by closing schools?

### Gupta

Likewise, it's hard for me to imagine how you might think that Sunetra Gupta is an advocate of horizontal interdiction rather than risk stratification.  Every speck of research she has presented, and every word of advocacy she has spoke, are consistent in this regard (and frankly, she is joined by basically all of CBEM, which of course is also at Oxford).

Here's [an interview with her from last week](https://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2020/09/18/epidemiologist-gives-the-world-a-reality-check-about-wuhan-coronavirus-n2576472):

&gt; ""It’s not deadly in a very large section of the population, so that presents us with this workable solution where by we can stop testing them, let them get on with their lives, let them go to school and receive something that incredibly valuable to them which is education and training. Let people keep jobs, let them feed their children. Let's preserve all of these things. Let the arts continue, or resume and flourish. We can do all this and by aggressively protecting, I think maybe shielding isn't the right word, aggressively protecting those who are are indeed vulnerable to this, which of course can be very deadly in a certain sector of the population,"" Dr. Gupta said.  ""The good news is we know now who is vulnerable to a very large degree. We know that.""

As is often the case with Gupta, it doesn't get much clearer than that.  There is no dispute that she's on the short list of the most insightful and accomplished epidemiologists in history, and here she is saying something that is going basically unheard in public policy responses.

Can I ask: how seriously do you follow epidemiology?  I don't mean to be rude; I recognize that (and I think this is alarming) a lot of people don't treat it with the same level of attention as, say, information tech or climate change.  But if you seriously don't realize that Osterholm and CIDRAP are advocates of risk-stratified approaches, not only with COVID but with Influenza and as a general response to most infectious disease, then it makes me think you are probably a beginner.  Which is totally fine, but you are kinda coming at me as if I'm whistlin' dixie - and I'm not an expert either - but I do at least routinely read CIDRAP materials (and have since long before COVID).  If you have an open mind and willingness to learn, then I think that the four experts I've mentioned are wonderful resources in this field.

&gt; However, I still think the idea of advocating the infections of as many people as possible with a novel virus we know nothing about is beyond reckless, regardless of age or percieved risk.

Consider that nearly every coronavirus does indeed run an acute course through society.  The difference here is that this particular virus is vicious and often lethal to the highest risk strata.  But for the lowest risk strata, ""the behavior of SARS-CoV-2 is closer to the behavior of garden variety coronavirus"" [as John Ioannidis puts it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwaPRdSoBIA).

&gt; I agree with your points on college students. I thought we were talking about kids. 

Then I have to wonder if you even took a glance at the report that we're discussing here, which is examining the role of people aged 20-29 in covid spread.  It's fine if you didn't - I think we all comment without reading.

But I think that if you slow down just a bit, you'll realize that there is a giant chorus of experts around the world that are putting out far more informed research than this disappointing CDC report, and that their opinions are not making their way into very much of the political and media dialogue.

&gt; Either way, clearly you argued your point well because I went from +5 upvotes on my comment to -3 since you responded lmao. We'll just have to agree to disagree.

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j4fc05,t1_g7kwj5b,g7ln420,"Not necessarily. Can we prove that past exposure provides lasting immunity to influenza?  The virus mutates frequently, but there’s a reason that we get flu shots every year. Not having had the flu or being exposed does not translate to a severe infection. 

Additionally, severity of RSV has less to do with exposure or viral load. 

“To investigate, Santtu Heinonen, a researcher at The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, and colleagues studied the composition of immune cells and the activity of immune-related genes in blood samples from a group of 190 young children, including 125 children with RSV infections and 65 healthy children.

Surprisingly, the authors saw that children who developed mild cases actually had higher amounts of virus compared with children who required hospitalization. In the mild cases, children were more likely to also be infected with rhinovirus — which causes the common cold — or another respiratory virus.

The children with mild cases displayed higher activity of genes involved in the production of interferons — molecules that are important in the innate immune response — but had less expression of inflammatory genes. In contrast, the hospitalized children showed an uncontrolled inflammatory response, and displayed poorer activation of immune cells called monocytes, according to Mejias.”

Yes, I find this frustrating too..  it's like the way we can check some parameters of Sars-CoV-2 infection has been extrapolated to define the disease itself:

E.g. 1:  A throat swab can pick up virus within a few days of exposure so therefore the virus must infect the throat first...  which is then is extrapolated to the ""descending"" infection disease model (URT-&gt;LRT)...

E.g. 2:  We can take a measurement of the amount of virus in the pharynx so we'll extrapolate this as a measure of ""viral load"" in the body, and we'll also accept this as a measure of transmissibility...

Now, there's no black &amp; white here but both examples are dogma and majorly flawed. Pharyngeal testing is done only out of convenience - the site is easily reached with a swab.  That's about it.

As it turns out, an ascending disease model (i.e. LRT-&gt;URT) appears to fit much better with several aspects of Sars-CoV-2 infections - particularly the epidemiology.

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j3vly1,t1_g7kpv6t,g7mp0uo,"&gt;This strategy of quarantine the high risk people has been mentioned a lot. Overall seems pretty reasonable.

Until you consider the fact the President of the United states just contracted it. Also, there's wayyyy more high risk people than you realize and this virus is still killing around 1 out of every 100 people who catch it. As a young, healthy adult you're in the minority.

I know this strategy sounds appealing, and this guy makes it sound like it has support from the scientific community, but it's literally not possible, and it doesn't. People don't know when they're infected and they spread it to others. This pandemic has gotten as huge as it has because of that fact. The only way people can be sure they don't spread it to family or friends, is to 100% not see family and friends... At all.

And what if it never quits circulating? What if herd immunity through infections is a myth? We're just going to tell people ""don't go see your 75 year old mom for 3 years, and if you do and she gets infected it's your fault""? There is absolutely no way to protect or isolate the vulnerable here (40% of our population) without giving them a shit load of cash, telling them to imprison themselves in their homes for 2 years, and pray the strategy actually works. We most certainly don't have enough evidence to support the possibility of herd immunity, and no other major contagious viruses behave that way (without a vaccine).

There are ZERO respectable scientists who support the idea of letting everyone get infected super quick, and this dude is lying when he says there are.

Well worth reading.
Looks in particular why children seem to be less affected...

Excerpt: 
British scientists have launched a major study aimed at uncovering the critical role that human antibodies and other immune defences play in the severity of Covid-19 cases.

Results could support some scientists’ belief that antibodies triggered by common colds could be protecting children against the disease. Alternatively, the study could confirm other researchers’ fears that some immune responses to the virus may trigger deadly inflammatory reactions that could bedevil attempts to create anti-Covid vaccines.

“This study could go in two very different directions,” said Michael Levin, professor of paediatrics at Imperial College London. “It could reveal that cross-reacting antibodies explain why children are less likely to suffer from severe Covid-19, or it might show patients’ own immune responses cause life-threatening effects",1,t2_1jopkpkc,2020-10-04 14:22:41,/r/COVID19/comments/j4ubf8/scientists_study_whether_immune_response_wards/g7mpzvl/,0

I have recently read that a possible reason for this anosmia is due to the enzyme ACE-2, which is a entry point for SARS-CoV-2. This enzyme is found in the heart, lungs, throat, gut and nose found at a higher abundance in the tissues used to detect odours. The cells burst when infected by COVID-19, producing an inability to smell. The effects seem to be temporory though some patients reported a distorted sense of smell

In liver transplant (LT) recipients with severe COVID-19 fatal outcome has been reported in a substantial subset of patients. Whether LT recipients are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 compared to the general population is controversial. Here we report the first results of a SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey in a large LT recipient cohort. Taking into account known risk factors, LT recipients a priori represented a high-risk cohort for severe COVID-19 with 101/219 (46.1 %) presenting with more than 2 risk factors for severe COVID-19. Out of 219 LT recipients 8 (3.7%) were either tested positive for nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA or anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum IgG. 5/8 (62.5 %) did not show any clinical signs of infection, 3/8 (37.5%) had self-limited disease, none required hospitalization for COVID-19. 5/8 (67.5%) SARS-CoV-2 positive patients showed high utilization of the healthcare system. 2/8 (25 %) had known exposure to infected health care personal. A majority of 65.4 % often or always avoided outside family social contacts. Face masks were commonly worn by all patients. In summary, LT recipients showed a SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion rate similar to the general population with a substantial percentage of unrecognized infections.

**Importance**

COVID-19 racial disparities have gained significant attention yet little is known about how age distributions obscure racial-ethnic disparities in COVID-19 case fatality ratios (CFR).

**Objective**

We filled this gap by assessing relevant data availability and quality across states, and in states with available data, investigating how racial-ethnic disparities in CFR changed after age adjustment. 

**Design/Setting/Participants/Exposure**

We conducted a landscape analysis as of July 1st, 2020 and developed a grading system to assess COVID-19 case and death data by age and race in 50 states and DC. In states where age- and race-specific data were available, we applied direct age standardization to compare CFR across race-ethnicities. We developed an online dashboard to automatically and continuously update our results. 

**Main Outcome and Measure**Our main outcome was CFR (deaths per 100 confirmed cases). We examined CFR by age and race-ethnicities. Results: We found substantial variations in disaggregating and reporting case and death data across states. Only three states, California, Illinois and Ohio, had sufficient age- and race-ethnicity-disaggregation to allow the investigation of racial-ethnic disparities in CFR while controlling for age. In total, we analyzed 391,991confirmed cases and 17,612 confirmed deaths. The crude CFRs varied from, e.g. 7.35% among Non-Hispanic (NH) White population to 1.39% among Hispanic population in Ohio. After age standardization, racial-ethnic differences in CFR narrowed, e.g. from 5.28% among NH White population to 3.79% among NH Asian population in Ohio, or an over one-fold difference. In addition, the ranking of race-ethnic-specific CFRs changed after age standardization. NH White population had the leading crude CFRs whereas NH Black and NH Asian population had the leading and second leading age-adjusted CFRs respectively in two of the three states. Hispanic populations age-adjusted CFR were substantially higher than the crude. Sensitivity analysis did not change these results qualitatively. Conclusions and Relevance: The availability and quality of age- and race-ethnic-specific COVID-19 case and death data varied greatly across states. Age distributions in confirmed cases obscured racial-ethnic disparities in COVID-19 CFR. Age standardization narrows racial-ethnic disparities and changes ranking. Public COVID-19 data availability, quality, and harmonization need improvement to address racial disparities in this pandemic.",1,t2_blqmw,2020-10-04 20:14:53,/r/COVID19/comments/j4xzlp/racialethnic_disparities_in_case_fatality_ratio/g7o4xb4/,0

Comorbidities included hypertension (50%), diabetes (30%), immunosuppression (18%), chronic kidney disease (17%), cardiovascular disease (8%), asthma (6%), or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (5%). Median body mass index was 28 (25–32) kg/m−2.

&gt;Overall, 146 (39%) patients received HFNC (all within the first 24 h after ICU admission) and were compared with 233 patients who did not. Table 1 shows the patients characteristics. None of the variables depicting patients’ characteristics at baseline significantly differed between the two groups. Patients who received HFNC were admitted after a longer period since symptoms onset, but time since hospital admission was not different. PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 126 (86–189) mm Hg and 130 (97–195) mm Hg in the patients who received HFNC and those who did not, respectively (P = 0.43). Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at Day 1 was significantly lower in patients with HFNC (4 [3–5] vs. 6 [3–9], P = 0.001), which was consistent with a lower proportion of patients with acute kidney injury (40% vs. 60%, P &lt; 0.0001) and vasopressors (29% vs. 53%, P &lt; 0.0001).
The proportion of patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation at Day 28 was 56% (95% confidence interval [CI], 47–64) vs. 75% (95% CI, 70–81; P &lt; 0.0001 [Gray test]).

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j4yu23,t3_j4yu23,g7oh1zd,"#Abstract

**Background**

Outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 have occurred worldwide in Long Term Care Facilities (LTCFs), but the reasons why some facilities are particularly vulnerable to infection are poorly understood. We aimed to identify risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and outbreaks in LTCFs.

**Methods**

Cross-sectional survey of all LTCFs providing dementia care or care to adults &gt;65 years in England with linkage to SARS-CoV-2 test results. Exposures included: LTCF characteristics, staffing factors, and use of disease control measures. Main outcomes included risk factors for infection and outbreaks, estimated using multivariable logistic regression, and survey and test-based weighted estimates of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence.

**Findings**

5126/9081 (56%) LTCFs participated in the survey, with 160,033 residents and 248,594 staff. The weighted period prevalence of infection in residents and staff respectively was 10.5% (95% CI: 9.9-11.1%) and 3.8% (95%: 3.4-4.2%) and 2724 LTCFs (53.1%) had at least one case of infection. Odds of infection and/or outbreaks were reduced in LTCFs that paid sickness pay, cohorted staff, did not employ agency staff and had higher staff to resident ratios. Higher odds of infection and outbreaks were identified in facilities with more admissions, lower cleaning frequency, poor compliance with isolation and for profit status.

The consensus is 60-70% of the world population. Some communities will have a higher treshold and some a lower one. For example here in Italy the spread in Bergamo significantly decreased and keeps staying low in spite of  the recent resurgence of cases in the country, and the estimate is that 60% of the population was exposed. 

I honestly don't know why they keep pushing the idea that heard immunity won't work. From what I figured it's not an ideal situation but that's quite literally the way EVERY other pandemic ended.

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j1cgjk,t1_g7lcrqz,g7okybb,"Realistically, community immunity (probably a better term than herd immunity, which sounds rather crude to most people) is the only way through a pandemic - it's just a question of whether it comes via natural means or via vaccination. Herd immunity is simply an equation - HI = 1-1/R0, with R0 being the reproductive rate, and you hit 'herd immunity' when a sufficient proportion of the population brings the R below or equal to 1. It's what has driven every emerging influenza virus that is now endemic to that point, and it's what keeps respiratory viruses in check. That said, it's a simple equation and likely doesn't take social heterogeneity into account - in other words, it doesn't account for the fact that some people are more likely to spread a virus than others (likely to a combination of social and physiological factors - things like being highly contagious whilst going about your daily business, for example, versus being highly contagious on a day that you decided to spend on the sofa watching Netflix), so that HI percentage could be a bit lower than what we've generally calculated for SARS-CoV-2, which is around 60-70%. It's probably somewhere in the 50-60% range, if I had to take an educated guess based on what we know so far. 

Herd immunity isn't a scientific problem, it's an ethical problem. Historically, we didn't have many tools to bring down the number of deaths associated with a pandemic or to generate a vaccine that would protect us - so ultimately, there were really no choices to be made. The pathogen ran through the population, and that was that. Now, however, we have tools to deal with pathogens - we have better infection control, we have pharmaceuticals, we have advanced technologies. So we've seen many previously more common serious illnesses become less common (measles/mumps/rubella/pertussis/chicken pox/diptheria/others), or even eradicated completely (smallpox) by vaccines, instead of being held in check by herd immunity. In addition, we haven't dealt with a true pandemic on this scale since 1918 - beyond terrorist attacks (which have a 'thing' to blame, actions that can be taken), we're not accustomed to mentally dealing with mass unavoidable death. So in turn, it becomes an ethics issue - how many deaths are ethically acceptable, how many non-COVID deaths are ethically acceptable?",1,t2_gh14o,2020-10-04 22:22:19,/r/COVID19/comments/j1cgjk/weekly_question_thread_week_of_september_28/g7okybb/,0

Or that people who are immune still have enough viral load to spread it? Or perhaps you think that a more open world wouldn't achieve herd immunity faster than waiting for a vaccine. Those are the reason I have heard, though I don't think they are correct. I was wondering if you had more information.

The whole idea being that natural herd immunity can be achieved faster than a vaccine. but also vaccines are a part of herd immunity as well. Individuals are immune by either recovering or getting a vaccine. And if a large percentage of the population is immune the virus no longer spreads excessively as it has few people to travel between. There is science for this and it had been well understand for a long time. Herd immunity is actually a key part in the usage of vaccines.

The Korean model is the other way. Monitor people very intensely to identify those who are sick and remove them until they recover. But that society lacks immunity so people can get COVID if they travel in and out of the country. So you need to lock down everyone on reentry. And that would basically be required until the rest of the world erradicates it, as Korean population has so little immunity. In Sweden this would still be necessary to monitor foreigners who come in.

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j1cgjk,t3_j1cgjk,g7q0e84,"[Please correct me if I got any of my facts/premises wrong]. 

Given that research shows that people are most infectious around 1-2 days prior to symptom onset but viral load (measured by pcr performed on nasopharyngeal samples) seems to peak at or a few days after symptom onset, doesn’t that mean that:

1. nasopharyngeal samples are inadequate to assess infectiousness and we should be pursuing other testing or specimen collection methods (like breathing into some kind of breathalyzer, like ones I saw they were developing).

2. The principle behind those rapid antigen saliva based tests proposed as means to detect infectiousness (as they would only read lower ct values) vs non-contagious infection is flawed.

3. People could remain infectious even after negative nasopharyngeal sample pcr.

4. The infection mode appears to be ascending rather than descending - rapid replication in the LRT, which would *usually* be the initial site of inoculation and then the infection would make it up to the URT, allowing its detection, which

5. really strengthens the case for aerosols as the primary mode transmission (deposition in the LRT/lungs).

**?**

And one last question:
If the initial site of infection was the upper respiratory tract as opposed to the LRT, would that mean that nasopharyngeal pcr would be more likely to turn positive earlier?",1,t2_6k1rw2ar,2020-10-05 04:56:42,/r/COVID19/comments/j1cgjk/weekly_question_thread_week_of_september_28/g7q0e84/,0

Right now, many states and nations engage in what is called forward or prospective contact tracing. Once an infected person is identified, we try to find out with whom they interacted afterward so that we can warn, test, isolate, and quarantine these potential exposures. But that’s not the only way to trace contacts. And, because of overdispersion, it’s not necessarily where the most bang for the buck lies. Instead, in many cases, we should try to work *backwards* to see who first infected the subject.

Because of overdispersion, most people will have been infected by someone who also infected other people, because only a small percentage of people infect many at a time, whereas most infect zero or maybe one person. As Adam Kucharski, an epidemiologist and the author of the book [*The Rules of Contagion*](http://kucharski.io/books/), explained to me, if we can use retrospective contact tracing to find the person who infected our patient, and *then* trace the forward contacts of the infecting person, we are generally going to find [a lot more cases](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.01.20166595v1.full.pdf) compared with forward-tracing contacts of the infected patient, which will merely identify *potential* exposures, many of which will not happen anyway, because most transmission chains die out on their own.""",2,t2_5cmwcvht,2020-10-05 07:53:38,/r/COVID19/comments/j595p7/this_overlooked_variable_is_the_key_to_the/g7qja6v/,0

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j4fc05,t1_g7lxjbi,g7qpll9,"Rather than exposure making our immune systems stronger, perhaps outbreaks kill those with mutations or DNA with weaknesses. After a large outbreak, it takes a generation or two to survive and procreate, and then the next wave gets killed, as those that were older survived. Perhaps our immune systems don’t necessarily grow stronger, but natural selection causes only those without said mutations or ancestral DNA to survive and procreate. 

The Spanish flu was completely novel, and younger people were more likely to have been more severely impacted due to living conditions and close proximity during WWI. By late summer 1918, the pandemic had spread across the entire continent, and the H1N1 virus had mutated into a deadlier strain that weakened the infected's immune system more than traditional influenzas. Some studies suggest that, in contrast to these traditional influenza viruses, having a stronger immune system (or interferon deficiency unrecognized in an otherwise healthy individual) was actually a liability in the case of the H1N1 virus as it triggered what is known as a ""cytokine storm"".  For this reason, the Spanish Flu had an uncommonly high fatality rate among young adults, who are traditionally the healthiest group in society.

A century ago, 9 of the 10 top causes of death were communicable diseases, and the average life span was 55 years old, so we didn’t have a large amount of people 60+, with many chronic comorbidities as we do today, so it’s an apples to oranges comparison. 

Also, the flu historically tends to impact young kids at a higher rate than SARS-CoV-2 does, and they are different viruses, but the reason that the Spanish Flu killed so many younger people may have been due to a higher percentage of younger people carrying the DNA with these mutations that hasn’t been killed by earlier outbreaks. Or, the flu could be more effective at targeting these interferons than SARS-CoV-2, even though SARS-CoV-2 has a higher R0. 

Has any study been done looking at how “healthy” people who get severe cases are otherwise?  Do they have an IgG deficiency, or a history of ear infections as children?  It would take a serious amount of data, but we could learn so much more about the immune system. 

Recent studies are showing a genetic defect of Interferons that lead to a cytokine storm in 14% of severe cases of Covid-19. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17665-9

Throughout history, viruses have played a role in evolution, as it is hypothesized that viruses are what led to Neanderthals dying out while Homo sapiens survived. Recent data has shown that people with a higher percentage of Neanderthal DNA, including Bangladeshi in the highest percentage, are more likely to have severe cases of Covid, and more fatalities. Spanish Flu as it evolved may gave been strong enough to kill off many people carrying those genes. 

“Antibodies to the body’s own cytokines, cell-signaling proteins of the immune system that include interferons, have been known to exacerbate other types of infections. The effect is the same as having a mutation that disrupts the production of that cytokine. “For example, if you have a mutation in gamma interferon or you have auto-antibodies against gamma interferon, which is a type II interferon, then you are prone to tuberculosis and related mycobacterial diseases,” Casanova says.

Still, he was stunned to find that the auto-antibodies were so prevalent among desperately ill COVID-19 patients, especially because they appear to be vanishingly rare in the general population. The researchers screened the blood of 1,227 healthy individuals and found only four (0.3 percent) with the auto-antibodies.”

While it makes for a nice story this seems to be not correct. I looked up my theory and found this to back it up:

&gt; Why was this flu so deadly to this particular group? The answer, according to work by the University of Arizona evolutionary biologist Michael Worobey, had to do with the flu viruses those victims encountered as children, decades before. As dominant flu strains change over time, **people born after 1889 had never encountered a strain similar to the Spanish flu, leaving them vulnerable in the pandemic.**

To your covid post, that seems interesting and I am curious to see where it takes us with the research in the decades to come. My personal theory, since March, is that all the other coronavirus are similar in danger to us, but as we encounter them early in our lives, we overcome them and that's it. This one (covid-19), being novel, just picks some very old that cant deal with it, while becoming endemic and ultimately harmless as the rest of the other coronavirus to us.",0,t2_285nnsrn,2020-10-05 10:38:28,/r/COVID19/comments/j4fc05/the_impact_of_covid19_public_health_measures_on/g7r00jo/,0

 found that unprotected hamsters got infected 67% of the time, mask material partition stimulating masks protecting the wearer reduced transmission to 25%, mask stimulating masks worn by the sick reduced transmission to 16%. This suggests that while masks are more effective when worn by the sick, they also protect the wearer. Interestingly, there is some preliminary evidence that people who got infected despite mask wearing are more likely to develop mild or asymptomatic infections, the idea is that the masks reduced the amount of virus that entered their body and made it easier to fight off. https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/ip2gwh/facial_masking_for_covid19_potential_for/",2,t2_g1t74,2020-10-05 10:43:12,/r/COVID19/comments/j1cgjk/weekly_question_thread_week_of_september_28/g7r0gn9/,0
COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j4fc05,t1_g7r00jo,g7r1nx6,"The first wave wasn’t deadly, and didn’t kill many healthy young adults, so if the theory of lack of immunity was the case, then we would have seen more deaths in this age group when the novel virus was first being transmitted, similar to how we had a huge wave of deaths when SARS-CoV-2 first circulated in Europe and the US in March and April. 

Also, any exposure during that first wave didn’t provide immunity during the far-more-deadly second wave, after the virus mutated. Cytokine storm doesn’t normally happen when a baby or young child is first exposed to the flu, even if the mother never received flu shots. 

“Reported cases of Spanish flu dropped off over the summer of 1918, and there was hope at the beginning of August that the virus had run its course. In retrospect, it was only the calm before the storm. Somewhere in Europe, a mutated strain of the Spanish flu virus had emerged that had the power to kill a perfectly healthy young man or woman within 24 hours of showing the first signs of infection.

In late August 1918, military ships departed the English port city of Plymouth carrying troops unknowingly infected with this new, far deadlier strain of Spanish flu. As these ships arrived in cities like Brest in France, Boston in the United States and Freetown in west Africa, the second wave of the global pandemic began.

“The rapid movement of soldiers around the globe was a major spreader of the disease,” says James Harris, a historian at Ohio State University who studies both infectious disease and World War I. “The entire military industrial complex of moving lots of men and material in crowded conditions was certainly a huge contributing factor in the ways the pandemic spread.

Not only was it shocking that healthy young men and women were dying by the millions worldwide, but it was also how they were dying. Struck with blistering fevers, nasal hemorrhaging and pneumonia, the patients would drown in their own fluid-filled lungs.

Only decades later were scientists able to explain the phenomenon now known as “cytokine explosion.” When the human body is being attacked by a virus, the immune system sends messenger proteins called cytokines to promote helpful inflammation. But some strains of the flu, particularly the H1N1 strain responsible for the Spanish flu outbreak, can trigger a dangerous immune overreaction in healthy individuals. In those cases, the body is overloaded with cytokines leading to severe inflammation and the fatal buildup of fluid in the lungs.

British military doctors conducting autopsies on soldiers killed by this second wave of the Spanish flu described the heavy damage to the lungs as akin to the effects of chemical warfare.”

Herd immunity will work through vaccination because 70% of the population will actually voluntarily get a vaccination (hopefully), rather than infect themselves with a novel virus that kills one out of every 100 people who get it. Do you understand what i'm trying to say? Maybe I should say it's ""risk stratification"" that is the myth. There is no way to stop a virus from spreading by making it spread really fast. You can't contain it in pockets because it **will** get out, and keep circulating, until those first pockets eventually lose their immunity and start getting infected all over again. We're not on a racetrack we're on a wheel.

I'm glad you brought up those points, though. I saw a press release a few days ago announcing a vaccine won't actually be ready by November. I wonder if it's a supply issue and not efficacy.

Herd immunity is what holds existing endemic respiratory viruses in check. It’s unlikely immunity is as short lived as 3 months - that appears to be the exception rather than the norm - and is likely closer to other endemic coronaviruses, which is somewhere around 12 months. Even with reinfection, you eventually get enough people with overlapping immunity periods that the R becomes less than 1. It’s also not like every person is infected simultaneously so then x months later everyone is naive again. In addition, your body maintains a memory against that pathogen - it isn’t sterilizing immunity, but it has a protective effect - and so it’s likely that subsequent reinfections will be less severe.",1,t2_gh14o,2020-10-05 14:11:40,/r/COVID19/comments/j1cgjk/weekly_question_thread_week_of_september_28/g7rgep3/,0

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j5eueu,t3_j5eueu,g7rj4lz," Publication, based on an Interview with Longfonds Director, Michael Rutgers Dutch Lung foundation: 

Health of Corona patients at home in alarmingly poor health even after months. 

The health of many Corona patients who have not been admitted to hospital is still 'frighteningly poor' after months. That's what Longfonds director Michael Rutgers says. Many home patients even have problems walking. Fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pressure, headaches, muscle aches: almost three months after the first symptoms typical for the virus, part of the Corona patients who were sick at home still have serious complaints. This was the conclusion of a survey carried out by the Dutch Lung Foundation together with the treatment and knowledge centre CIRO and Maastricht University among more than 1600 people with Corona type complains. No less than 95 percent of those surveyed indicated that they had problems with simple daily activities. Longfonds director Michael Rutgers. „We're really shocked by this. More than six in ten even have problems walking.'' Of the people who participated in the study, 91 percent have never been in hospital because of Corona, and 43 percent have not been diagnosed by a doctor. ""This is the first time that this large patient group has been identified. These people really need to be seen, heard and helped,'' says Rutgers. „We need to prevent this group of patients from ending up invisible after corona.'' The average age of participants in the study is 53 years. By far the largest group (85 percent) says that their health was good before the Corona infection; now only 6 percent experience good health. Nearly half of them said that they were no longer able to exercise after the corona infection. The health of corona patients who have experienced the disease at home is frighteningly poor,'' explains the Longfonds director. Until now, the focus has been - rightly so - on the people who have ended up in the hospital or even on the ICU. But we shouldn't forget this group of home-based Corona patients.'' Patients with lung problems after Corona can visit an online platform 'Coronalongplein' of the Lung Fund and the Lung Alliance Netherlands (LAN). There is also a 12,000 member Facebook group with Corona experiences and long-term complaints. Rutgers: ""That thousands to tens of thousands of people still have complaints is certain; the question is whether that will remain so in the long run.” Veterinarian Marcel de Kruijff is one of those patients: “The RIVM says that you can go back into the wide world if you are free of complaints for 24 hours, but that's not how it works. Everyone will think: this guy has to get a kick in the ass and then he'll be fine. But it really doesn't work.” 

Top 10 most frequently mentioned complaints, almost three months after the first symptoms Fatigue (87.8%) Shortness of breath or tightness of breath (74.2%) Chest pressure (45.4%) Headache (39.8%) Muscle pain (36.2%) Pain between shoulder blades (35.2%) Palpitations (32.7%) Increased resting heart rate (30.1%) Dizziness (28.6%) Coughing (28.3%)

This paper assesses the age specificity of the infection fatality rate (IFR) for COVID-19 using results from 28 seroprevalence studies as well as five countries that have engaged in comprehensive tracing of COVID-19 cases.

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j5hqiu,t3_j5hqiu,g7s5lpl,"&gt;Looking for factors independently associated with thrombotic events, the researchers found only one after multivariable adjustment: higher white blood cell count (OR 1.10; 95% CI 1.02-1.19). Surprisingly, Cameron said, that was driven by neutrophils and not lymphocytes. “Typically lymphocytes are what we expect to track with how well someone is responding to a virus,” he explained. “This is highly unusual for you to have a viral infection but then have the neutrophil count be the only predictor . . . of whether they’re going to get thrombotic events.”  
&gt;  
&gt;What that means, he said, “is that while people are focusing on mechanisms of thrombosis, it’s critical that they keep in mind that systemic inflammation, in ways that we’ve never seen before, seems to be very prominent in this disease.”

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j5koil,t3_j5koil,g7sp5bn,"&gt;Abstract  
&gt;  
&gt;There is an urgent need for new treatments to prevent and ameliorate severe illness and death induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-19 patients. The coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-1 causes pneumonitis in mice which shares many pathological characteristics with human SARS-CoV infection.   
&gt;  
&gt;Previous studies have shown that the amino acid gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has anti-inflammatory effects. We tested whether oral treatment with GABA could modulate the MHV-1 induced pneumonitis in susceptible A/J mice. As expected, MHV-1-inoculated control mice became severely ill (as measured by weight loss, clinical score, and the ratio of lung weight to body weight) and &gt;60% of them succumbed to the infection.   
&gt;  
&gt;In contrast, mice that received GABA immediately after MHV-1 inoculation became only mildly ill and all of them recovered. When GABA treatment was initiated after the appearance of illness (3 days post-MHV-1 infection), we again observed that GABA treatment significantly reduced the severity of illness and greatly increased the frequency of recovery.   
&gt;  
&gt;Therefore, the engagement of GABA receptors (GABA-Rs) prevented the MHV-1 infection-induced severe pneumonitis and death in mice. Given that GABA-R agonists, like GABA and homotaurine, are safe for human consumption, stable, inexpensive, and available worldwide, they are promising candidates to help prevent severe illness stemming from SARS-CoV-2 infection and other coronavirus strains",1,t2_1g543a,2020-10-05 23:32:56,/r/COVID19/comments/j5koil/gaba_administration_prevents_severe_illness_and/g7sp5bn/,0

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j5lwk8,t3_j5lwk8,g7ss0h0,"&gt;**Abstract**

&gt;Four different endemic coronaviruses (eCoVs) are etiologic agents for the seasonal “common cold,” and these 
eCoVs share extensive sequence homology with human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 
(SARS-CoV-2). Here, we show that individuals with as compared to without a relatively recent documented 
eCoV were tested at greater frequency for respiratory infections but had similar rate of SARS-CoV-2
acquisition. Importantly, the patients with a previously detected eCoV had less severe coronavirus disease-
2019 (COVID-19) illness. Our observations suggest that pre-existing immune responses against endemic 
human coronaviruses can mitigate disease manifestations from SARS-CoV-2 infection.


&gt;**Taken from results**:

&gt;The eCoV+ as compared to eCoV- hospitalized patients had a significantly lower odds for intensive 
care unit (ICU) admission (OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.0 – 0.7) and a trend towards lower odds of mechanical ventilation
(OR 0.0, 95% CI 0.0 – 1.0). The odds of ICU care (OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.1–0.9) remained significantly lower in the 
eCoV+ as compared to eCoV- patients after adjusting for age, gender, BMI, and DM. The percentage of 
hospitalized patients that eventually died over follow up was lower in the eCoV+ (4.8%) as compared to the 
eCoV- (17.7%) group. Survival probability was significantly higher in the hospitalized eCoV+ as compared to 
eCoV- COVID-19 hospitalized patients (hazard ratio (HR) 0.3, 95% CI 0.1 – 0.7, Fig. 2). After adjusting for age, 
gender, BMI, and DM, the HR remained 0.3, although the confidence interval became much wider and
encompassed unity (0.0 – 2.0). Cumulatively, these observations suggest that recent documented eCoV 
infection is associated with less severe COVID-19.",1,t2_afaoc,2020-10-05 23:57:09,/r/COVID19/comments/j5lwk8/jci_recent_endemic_coronavirus_infection_is/g7ss0h0/,0

&gt;  
&gt;**Background** The stability of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on human skin remains unknown, considering the hazards of viral exposure to humans. We generated a model that allows the safe reproduction of clinical studies on the application of pathogens to human skin and elucidated the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on the human skin.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Methods** We evaluated the stability of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus (IAV), mixed with culture medium or upper respiratory mucus, on human skin surfaces and the dermal disinfection effectiveness of 80% (w/w) ethanol against SARS-CoV-2 and IAV.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Results** SARS-CoV-2 and IAV were inactivated more rapidly on skin surfaces than on other surfaces (stainless steel/glass/plastic); the survival time was significantly longer for SARS-CoV-2 than for IAV \[9.04 h (95% confidence interval: 7.96–10.2 h) vs. 1.82 h (1.65–2.00 h)\]. IAV on other surfaces was inactivated faster in mucus versus medium conditions, while SARS-CoV-2 showed similar stability in the mucus and medium; the survival time was significantly longer for SARS-CoV-2 than for IAV \[11.09 h (10.22–12.00 h) vs. 1.69 h (1.57–1.81 h)\]. Moreover, both SARS-CoV-2 and IAV in the mucus/medium on human skin were completely inactivated within 15 s by ethanol treatment.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Conclusions** The 9-h survival of SARS-CoV-2 on human skin may increase the risk of contact transmission in comparison with IAV, thus accelerating the pandemic. Proper hand hygiene is important to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections.",2,t2_1g543a,2020-10-06 00:43:47,/r/COVID19/comments/j5jt0g/survival_of_sarscov2_and_influenza_virus_on_the/g7sy54n/,0

&gt;**Introduction** Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has shown efficacy against COVID-19 in some but not all studies. We hypothesized that systematic review would show HCQ to be: effective against COVID-19, more effective when used earlier, not associated with worsening, and safe.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Methods** We searched PubMed, Cochrane, EmBase, Google Scholar, and Google for all reports on hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19 patients. This included pre-prints and preliminary reports on larger COVID-19 studies. We examined the studies for efficacy, time of administration and safety.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Results** HCQ was found consistently effective against COVID-19 when used early, in the outpatient setting. It was found overall effective also including inpatient studies. No unbiased study found worse outcomes with HCQ use. No mortality or serious safety adverse event was found

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j3vly1,t1_g7rd23a,g7t7kf3,"Right. Herd Immunity can be achieved either way. But your main point would be that the cost of doing it with natural immunity is too high. The outcome will be worse when compared to measures of locking down, holding off many of the normal things we do until we get a vaccine.

To me that's still unclear. Those who argue for going the natural route claim that the impacts of the lockdown are worse than the impacts the virus would have. Their biggest argument is that the lockdown killa more than the virus indirectly. Due to increasing suicide, child abuse, and drug overdose which occur when people lose their jobs, become impoverished, etc.

Ultimately some sort of cost benefit analysis which needs to be done an explored to understand the difference between these two options. In engineering we always do this when we have a few paths to pursue on any project. Granted this will also be based on predictions and assumptions which could be right or wrong, or off in magnitude. For either option pursued. And there would be value functions assigned to the outcomes. I.e. is locking someone down for a year half as bad as losing a year of your life, one quarter as bad, etc. Is the death of a young person worse than the death of an older person, if so by how much? Remaining life expectancy? Or some other metric. And how much value do you put on the non life vs life differences between the two choices. I.e. increasing poverty, unemployment, lack of access to goods and services, etc.

I don't think there is a solution in either route. Simply a trade-off between two choices which really need to be understood",1,t2_14q66u,2020-10-06 01:55:27,/r/COVID19/comments/j3vly1/changing_age_distribution_of_the_covid19_pandemic/g7t7kf3/,0

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j5juhf,t1_g7tff51,g7tkwxo,"When we say that someone has antibodies ""for"" a pathogen, we mean that the antibodies fit like a lock and key to bind to a part of that pathogen (called an ""epitope"").

Antibodies can serve two purposes, though: they can act as a chemical ""flag"" to mark the pathogen for destruction, or they can directly inhibit the pathogen's ability to infect and replicate. If it does this, it's a neutralizing antibody.

With coronaviruses we're usually interested in antibodies that bind to part of the virus called the nucleocapsid (N), spike (S) or receptor-binding-domain (RBD). Antibodies that bind to S and RBD are often neutralizing, they block the virus from being able to infect at all. Antibodies to N are often not but may still play a role in controlling the infection.

There are some viruses where you can have all the antibodies in the world and they don't help, like HIV.

Based on ""natural experiments"" like an outbreak of the virus on a fishing boat, and intentional experiments like directly exposing monkeys to the virus after getting a vaccine or being previously infected, it's as certain as scientists are willing to be that this virus works like most others, ie, having enough neutralizing antibodies against it will prevent you from getting infected for a time.

What isn't known is: how much is enough? how long after infection or vaccination will you have enough? Is it enough to have antibodies in your blood or do you need the type that circulate in mucus to completely prevent all infection? This is what the vaccine trials aim to determine.

In enough time, antibodies will wane, and the virus may still be around, in which case the question becomes whether the immune system's retained cellular memory will continue to prevent serious illness after that.",5,t2_593zf,2020-10-06 03:45:06,/r/COVID19/comments/j5juhf/weekly_question_thread_week_of_october_05/g7tkwxo/,0

That implies some kind of fundamental difference between the two. I don't know what that might be, but whatever it is, it's a reasonably important question - of the two, it's more likely that we're wrong about how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted (we just have less experience of it). Does that mean that the hypotheses about children somehow being dramatically less infectious are correct, or does it mean that SARS-CoV-2 is very weak at transmitting by some means that rhinovirus is much better at transmitting by (say, fomite transmission)?

Note that this study only looked at severe cases. Mild/asymptomatic cases are expected to do better. However, a separate study from the Lancet reported that subjective symptoms can linger after radiological changes have healed.

Based on how mild these findings are, I expect the vast majority to make a full recovery, but it would be impossible to say for sure without a follow-up study.

We already knew people generate aerosols, and knew that aerosols can linger for a few hours in poorly ventilated areas. An ""Expert"" on CBC back in March mentioned this thing isn't airborne by definition, because it doesn't linger around for days. Obviously a huge downplay/simplification, but the article only mentions it lingers for a couple hours.. 

They are now saying.. ""Individuals with COVID-19, many of whom have no symptoms, release thousands of virus-laden aerosols and far fewer droplets when breathing and talking (4–6)."". 

So it looks like the idea is that people spread aerosols more than previously thought. The initial narrative was that dropllettes were the main concern and aerosols  only spread unless someone coughs or something, but the article talks like asymptomatic people spread it like wildfire - they dont cough. So it looks like a push to address this as an airborne virus by taking the blinders off and actually have the discussion on how we protect ourselves better, implement proper indoor air ventilation, etc.. but again, no new information was provided and the sources provided date as far back as june 2020.

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j5queo,t1_g7tz829,g7u830n,"Simply put. Like super layman, is that when you cough, sneeze, talk or even breath, you exhale tiny, minuscule water droplets. Scientist believed that is how it spread, hence it needs a medium. Thus you need a sick person around, or being enclosed indoors with them to doing the actions above. Why? Albeit those droplets are flying around, they will eventually hit the ground. The droplets will be wet and sticky for a while. Hence washing your hands was vital as you could have touched a source and then touched your face. 

Airborne means that it can exist in aerosols in the air. Depending on conditons for perhaps hours at a time. Thus, it is quite feasible for you to walk into say, an empty elavator, with an infected person having used it earlier and you could get sick even if you don't touch anything, by just breathing in the same air. This means face shields are useless without a mask. Also, that the concept of 6 feet which was always wrong to begin with --since papers months ago suggested that droplets from coughs or sneezes could reach 27 feet-- is now extra useless. Since the virus can travel beyond mere 6 feet. You no longer need to be near someone. They just have to have been there. As to how long? That depends. Safe bet is to stick to not enclosed places, and wear a well fitting mask.

We partially account for behavioral responses usingGoogle mobility data. Our identification approach exploits variation in the timing of  indoor  face  maskmandates  staggered  over  two  months  in  the  34  public  health  regions  in Ontario,   Canada's   most   populousprovince.   We   find   that,   in   the   first   few   weeks   after implementation,  mask  mandates  are  associatedwith  a  reduction  of  25  percent  in  the  weekly number   of   new   COVID-19   cases.   Additional   analysiswith   province-level   data   provides corroborating  evidence.  Counterfactual  policy  simulations  suggestthat  mandating  indoor  masks nationwide in early July could have reduced the weekly number of newcases in Canada by 25 to 40 percent in mid-August, which translates into 700 to 1,100 fewer casesper week.",3,t2_7755hegr,2020-10-06 07:05:09,/r/COVID19/comments/j5tqx2/face_masks_public_policies_and_slowing_the_spread/g7uaolq/,0

Background

Prominent clinical symptoms of COVID-19 include CNS manifestations. However, it is unclear whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, gains access to the CNS and whether it causes neuropathological changes. We investigated the brain tissue of patients who died from COVID-19 for glial responses, inflammatory changes, and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS.

Methods

In this post-mortem case series, we investigated the neuropathological features in the brains of patients who died between March 13 and April 24, 2020, in Hamburg, Germany. Inclusion criteria comprised a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and availability of adequate samples. We did a neuropathological workup including histological staining and immunohistochemical staining for activated astrocytes, activated microglia, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the olfactory bulb, basal ganglia, brainstem, and cerebellum. Additionally, we investigated the presence and localisation of SARS-CoV-2 by qRT-PCR and by immunohistochemistry in selected patients and brain regions.

Findings

43 patients were included in our study. Patients died in hospitals, nursing homes, or at home, and were aged between 51 years and 94 years (median 76 years [IQR 70–86]). We detected fresh territorial ischaemic lesions in six (14%) patients. 37 (86%) patients had astrogliosis in all assessed regions. Activation of microglia and infiltration by cytotoxic T lymphocytes was most pronounced in the brainstem and cerebellum, and meningeal cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration was seen in 34 (79%) patients. SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in the brains of 21 (53%) of 40 examined patients, with SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins found in cranial nerves originating from the lower brainstem and in isolated cells of the brainstem. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS was not associated with the severity of neuropathological changes.

Interpretation

In general, neuropathological changes in patients with COVID-19 seem to be mild, with pronounced neuroinflammatory changes in the brainstem being the most common finding. There was no evidence for CNS damage directly caused by SARS-CoV-2. The generalisability of these findings needs to be validated in future studies as the number of cases and availability of clinical data were low and no age-matched and sex-matched controls were included.",3,t2_505k49k6,2020-10-06 08:14:48,/r/COVID19/comments/j5v24l/neuropathology_of_patients_with_covid19_in/g7ui0sk/,0

Even medical personnel using masks, shields, gowns and gloves have been affected. And in heavily affected areas we saw personnel in sealed biosuits, and/or patients wearing sealed isolation bubbles. 

The discrepancy can be resolved if we change the postulated transmission method from droplets to aerosols and that seems to be the  letter intent. We should be aware that masks, eye protection, distancing, and hand hygiene won’t prevent infection — although they still might and are probably likely to reduce initial virus load, thus symptom severity.

Potentially that is true, and you could even argue that it is more likely to be true than not, but this is a novel virus and we simply don't know how it works. That's worth remembering. Keeping an eye on the state of large numbers of post-COVID patients is critical to measure patient outcomes.

&gt; Post-polio syndrome... is a group of latent symptoms of poliomyelitis (polio), occurring at about a 25 to 40% rate (latest data greater than 80%)... Symptoms typically occur 15 to 30 years after an initial acute paralytic attack. Symptoms include decreasing muscular function or acute weakness with pain and fatigue. The same symptoms may also occur years after a nonparalytic polio (NPP) infection. 

&gt; [...]

&gt; After a period of prolonged stability, individuals who had been infected and recovered from polio begin to experience new signs and symptoms, characterised by muscular atrophy (decreased muscle mass), weakness, pain, and fatigue in limbs that were originally affected or in limbs that did not seem to have been affected at the time of the initial polio illness. PPS is a very slowly progressing condition marked by periods of stability followed by new declines in the ability to carry out usual daily activities. Most patients become aware of their decreased capacity to carry out daily routines due to significant changes in mobility and decreasing upper limb function and lung capability. Fatigue is often the most disabling symptom; even slight exertion often produces disabling fatigue and can also intensify other symptoms. Problems breathing or swallowing, sleep-related breathing disorders, such as sleep apnea, and decreased tolerance for cold temperatures are other notable symptoms.

&gt; Increased activity during healthy years between the original infection and onset of PPS can amplify the symptoms. Thus, contracting polio at a young age can result in particularly disabling PPS symptoms.

Is air conditioning helping spread COVID in the South?

https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/06/air-conditioning-may-be-factor-in-covid-19-spread-in-the-south/

“The researchers found that in indoor spaces, good ventilation will filter some of the virus out of the air, but may leave more viral particles on surfaces. In the classroom setting, after running a 50-minute simulation with an asymptomatic teacher consistently talking, the researchers found that only 10 percent of the aerosols were filtered out. The majority of the particles were instead deposited on the walls.

Because this is very strong ventilation, we thought it would ventilate out a lot of aerosols. But, 10 percent is really a small number,” said Yang, who holds the Richard and Barbara Nelson Assistant Professorship in Mechanical Engineering. “The ventilation forms several circulation zones called vortexes, and the aerosols keep rotating in this vortex. When they collide with the wall, they attach to the wall. But, because they are basically trapped in this vortex, and it’s very hard for them to reach the vent and actually go out.”

In each scenario, the researchers mapped the air flow to find locations of virus “hot” spots, or where the aerosols congregated. With the right combination of ventilation and interior organization, it could be possible to mitigate the disease spread and avoid these hot zones, the researchers said.”

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j5ols4,t3_j5ols4,g7uzyt5,"Just a few notes from an engineering/physics perspective:

*Humans produce respiratory droplets ranging from 0.1 to 1000 µm. A competition between droplet size, inertia, gravity, and evaporation determines how far emitted droplets and aerosols will travel in air (*[***4***](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6498/1422.full#ref-4)*,* [***5***](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6498/1422.full#ref-5)*).*

The background air is also extremely important. The behaviour of a droplet in a vacuum will differ to that in surrounding air. They should also mention Brownian motion which may be important for droplets less than 20 micron and becomes significant for droplets/particles less than one micron in size.

*Larger respiratory droplets will undergo gravitational settling faster than they evaporate, contaminating surfaces and leading to contact transmission.*

Generally yes, but large droplets can become suspended for a large period of time if the air motion is sufficiently strong (I discuss this later a little bit but it depends on the Stokes number).

With regards to contaminating surfaces, yes this may be true, but note, in some rare cases, for droplet-particle collisions, you can get a collision outcome called ""bounce"". As the droplet approaches the surface, it looses kinetic energy, and does not have sufficient energy to overcome the thin strip of air that develops between the approaching droplet and the surface. This strip of air then effectively repels the droplet back out, and the surface and the droplet never make contact! I talk more about collisions later.

*Smaller droplets and aerosols will evaporate faster than they can settle, are buoyant,*

You have to be a little careful with buoyancy. Whilst what they say is correct, droplets are classified as ""dense"" in air, i.e. the density of the droplet is significantly larger than air. In this regime, you can often ignore buoyancy forces and this is done quite often in some literature papers. The dominant force is believed to be Stokes drag and, at least for small droplets and particles, the equation of motion is called ""the BBO equation"".

*Breezes and winds often occur and can transport infectious droplets and aerosols long distances.*

Well, yes and no. How far a particle or droplet travels in the air dispends partly on its Stokes number. If the Stokes number is sufficiently small, (say 0.01), then they will follow the air motion very well. In essence, they follow almost perfectly, the streamlines of the air flow. However, if the Stokes number is sufficiently large (anything larger than say 0.2), then the particles and droplets will not follow the air flow well and ""lag"" behind, due to their inertia. There they do **not** follow the streamlines of the air flow, and can actually cross the flow streamlines, which is in contrast to air molecules which cannot cross streamlines by definition.

The long story short is that you really need to quantify both the characteristics of the particle/droplet AND the surrounding air flow, before you can say whether it is transported large distances.

*Viral concentrations will be more rapidly diluted outdoors*

Generally yes this is true. But if the Stokes number of the particles and droplets is of the order of unity, you can get an affect called ""preferential concentration"" or ""clustering"". This is a phenomena where you can get regions of space (air in this case) where locally and instantaneously there are many droplets and regions in space where there are very few droplets. So yes, the overall effect is to lead to a dilution of concentration, but you can get localised regions in the flow where many droplets exist. These localised regions, called clusters, are believed to modify locally the air flow motion, and also, collectively, the droplets in these clusters are believed to have higher settling velocities. For large particles you can also get an effect called ""caustics"", where droplets form clusters because they arrive at one location from different parts of the flow field, due to their ability to cross streamlines. This is slightly different to the clustering effect because of the underlying physical mechanisms generating it, but the literature isn't so clear on that point.

I am curious to know if this is what they meant by spatial patterns in the sentence "" mechanisms of transmission; airborne concentrations; and **spatial patterns**"", since the clusters are effectively patterns if you like.

*Viruses can attach to other particles such as dust and pollution, which can modify the aerodynamic characteristics and increase dispersion.*

They are referring here to droplet-particle collisions or droplet-droplet collisions or particle-particle collisions. Each of those three have different collision outcomes depending on various factors including size, angle of collision (there are actually two angles in 3d), velocity, surface characteristics and background levels of surrounding gas turbulence.

You cannot just say ""it increases dispersion"" because this depends significantly on the outcome of those collisions. For example, droplet-particle collisions, if a viral droplet collides with a particle with a high impact parameter (high angle), then you can get a ""splash"" type collision, where some of the liquid deposits on the surface of the particle, increasing its mass temporarily and leading to a slightly higher settling rate. But some of the liquid may break off, called ""secondary atomization"" or ""satellite droplets"" in the literature, and these droplets can disperse more easily because they have less inertia, but their liquid content may also evaporate more quickly, leaving behind any solid particulate that resided within the liquid droplet. So it isn't as simple as saying ""increase dispersion"".",2,t2_u4eo87j,2020-10-06 11:05:12,/r/COVID19/comments/j5ols4/reducing_transmission_of_sarscov2/g7uzyt5/,0

Aerosols are smaller, more casually produced, can go much further and hang out longer in the air as they are lighter. As they can float and are small diameter, they also require more serious PPE if they are harmful.

People suspected COVID could use aerosols because of its effectiveness in reaching large numbers of people in gatherings and its persistence despite widespread mask use, sophisticated contact tracing and 6 foot distancing. 6 foot distancing and masks will help with aerosols - the more, the worse - but one really needs respirators and sealed eye protection.

Our expectations should be based on what we know to date and comparisons to other coronaviruses and other viruses that present similarly (so... not polio), and should change as we get additional data.

Objective: The evidence pertaining to the effects of asthma on Coronavirus disease 2019 outcomes has been unclear. To improve our understanding of the clinically important association of asthma and Coronavirus disease 2019. Methods: A matched cohort study was performed using data from the Mass General Brigham Health Care System (Boston, MA). Adult (age ≥ 18 years) patients with confirmed Coronavirus disease 2019 and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, or interstitial lung disease between March 4, 2020 and July 2, 2020 were analyzed. Up to 5 non-asthma comparators were matched to each asthma patient based on age (within 5 years), sex, and date of positive test (within 7 days). The primary outcomes were hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and death, using multivariable Cox-proportional hazards models accounting for competing risk of death, when appropriate. Patients were followed for these outcomes from diagnosis of Coronavirus disease 2019 until July 2, 2020. Results: Among 562 asthma patients, 199 (21%) were hospitalized, 15 (3%) received mechanical ventilation, and 7 (1%) died. Among the 2686 matched comparators, 487 (18%) were hospitalized, 107 (4%) received mechanical ventilation, and 69 (3%) died. The adjusted Hazard Ratios among asthma patients were 0.99 (95% Confidence Internal 0.80, 1.22) for hospitalization, 0.69 (95% Confidence Internal 0.36, 1.29) for mechanical ventilation, and 0.30 (95% Confidence Internal 0.11, 0.80) for death.

## Abstract

### Background and Aim

COVID‐19 is a new pandemic disease recognized by the World Health Organization. It mainly affects the respiratory system, but it can also affect other systems. The gastrointestinal system has been found to be affected in many patients. This study investigated the COVID‐19‐related gastrointestinal manifestations and the effect of gastrointestinal involvement on the course and outcome of the disease.

### Methods

This was a retrospective descriptive study conducted on 140 COVID‐19 polymerase chain reaction‐positive symptomatic individuals admitted to Al‐Shafa Hospital – Medical City Complex in Baghdad, Iraq during the period 2 March 2020 to 12 May 2020. Demographic data and clinical presentation and laboratory data were extracted from the case sheets of the patients and were also obtained from direct communication with the patients, their families, and medical staff.

### Results

Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms alone were detected in 23.6% of the patients; 44.3% of the patients presented with only respiratory symptoms, and 32.1% presented with both respiratory and GI symptoms. Patients with only GI symptoms had less severe disease compared with those who had both GI and respiratory symptoms, who had more severe disease with higher mortality. Overall mortality was 8.6%, with no mortality in the GI symptoms alone group. The highest severity and mortality were in patients with both GI and respiratory symptoms (48.39 and 13.33%, respectively).

### Conclusions

COVID‐19‐related gastrointestinal symptoms are common, and their presence alone carries a better prognosis, but their presence with respiratory symptoms is associated with higher morbidity and mortality.",1,t2_5zu9thqe,2020-10-06 14:06:15,/r/COVID19/comments/j5zxg5/the_prevalence_of_gastrointestinal_symptoms_among/g7vdzzd/,0

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j5sz0y,t3_j5sz0y,g7vj9ao,"&gt;Abstract  
&gt;  
&gt;Effective and affordable treatments for patients suffering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are needed. We report in vitro efficacy of Artemisia annua extracts as well as artemisinin, artesunate, and artemether against SARS-CoV-2.   
&gt;  
&gt;The latter two are approved active pharmaceutical ingredients of anti-malarial drugs. Proof-of-concept for prophylactic efficacy of the extracts was obtained using a plaque-reduction assay in VeroE6 cells. Subsequent concentration-response studies using a high-throughput antiviral assay, based on immunostaining of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, revealed that pretreatment and treatment with extracts, artemisinin, and artesunate inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection of VeroE6 cells.   
&gt;  
&gt;In treatment assays, artesunate (50% effective concentration (EC50): 7 μg/mL) was more potent than the tested plant extracts (128-260 μg/mL) or artemisinin (151 μg/mL) and artemether (&gt;179 μg/mL), while generally EC50 in pretreatment assays were slightly higher. The selectivity index (SI), calculated based on treatment and cell viability assays, was highest for artemisinin (54), and roughly equal for the extracts (5-10), artesunate (6) and artemether (&lt;7). Similar results were obtained in human hepatoma Huh7.5 cells.   
&gt;  
&gt;Peak plasma concentrations of artesunate exceeding EC50 values can be achieved. Clinical studies are required to further evaluate the utility of these compounds as COVID-19 treatment.",1,t2_1g543a,2020-10-06 15:37:26,/r/COVID19/comments/j5sz0y/in_vitro_efficacy_of_artemisininbased_treatments/g7vj9ao/,0

Individuals can test positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) after no longer being infectious.1-8 Positive SARS-CoV-2 antigen-based testing exhibits a temporal pattern that corresponds with active, replicating virus and could therefore be a more accurate predictor of an individuals potential to transmit SARS-CoV-2.2,3,9 Using the BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2 later flow antigen detection test, we demonstrate a higher concordance of antigen-positive test results with the presence of cultured, infectious virus when compared to RT-PCR. When compared to infectious virus isolation, the sensitivity of antigen-based testing is similar to RT-PCR. The correlation between SARS-CoV-2 antigen and SARS-CoV-2 culture represents a significant advancement in determining the risk for potential transmissibility beyond that which can be achieved by detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA. Coupled with a rapid time-to-result, low cost, and scalability, antigen-based testing should facilitate effective implementation of testing and public health interventions that will better contain COVID-19.",1,t2_blqmw,2020-10-06 17:07:37,/r/COVID19/comments/j5zf76/antigenbased_testing_but_not_realtime_pcr/g7vnt4p/,0

NEW YORK and MAINZ, GERMANY, October 6, 2020 — Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced the initiation of a rolling submission to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for BNT162b2, the lead candidate from the companies’ vaccine development program against COVID-19. The EMA’s decision to start a rolling review follows the encouraging preliminary results from pre-clinical and early clinical studies in adults, which suggest that BNT162b2 triggers the production of neutralizing antibodies and TH-1 dominant CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that target SARS-CoV-2. A combination of an antibody and T cell response is believed to be important in eliciting protection against viral infection and disease. BioNTech and Pfizer plan to work with the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) to complete the rolling review process to facilitate the final Marketing Authorization Application (MAA).

As part of the rolling review, the CHMP has begun evaluating data generated in pre-clinical trials. The formal MAA submission could be finalized following the rolling review process, pending demonstration of vaccine efficacy and safety and confirmation from the EMA that the submitted data are adequate. The vaccine candidate will remain subject to the EMA’s diligent standards for quality, safety and efficacy.

“It is our duty to ensure that while we are working to develop a potential vaccine at unprecedented speed to help address this pandemic, we do so with the highest ethical standards while adhering to sound scientific principles. We will continue to have regular and open dialogue with the EMA throughout the rolling review process,” said Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech.

“A global crisis the magnitude of COVID-19 has completely transformed the vaccine development and review process,” said Peter Honig, M.D., Senior Vice President and Head of Worldwide Safety and Regulatory of Pfizer. “We are making every effort to develop a safe and effective vaccine following the guidance of regulatory agencies and are proud to take this historic step with the European Medicines Agency for our COVID-19 vaccine candidate, BNT162b2.”

The BNT162b2 vaccine candidate is based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA technology and supported by Pfizer’s global vaccine development and manufacturing capabilities. It encodes an optimized SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike glycoprotein (S), which is a target of virus neutralizing antibodies. The vaccine candidate is currently being evaluated in a global Phase 3 study ongoing at more than 120 clinical sites worldwide including the United States, Brazil, South Africa and Argentina. To date, the trial has enrolled approximately 37,000 participants with more than 28,000 having received their second vaccination.

Preliminary data from the Phase 1/2 portions of the study have demonstrated that BNT162b2 was well tolerated with mild to moderate adverse events in all age groups. The vaccine candidate generated dose level-dependent immunogenicity, as measured by receptor binding domain (RBD)-binding IgG concentrations and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers. In addition, BNT162b2-vaccinated human participants displayed a favorable breadth of epitopes recognized in T cell responses specific to the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen, and BNT162b2 demonstrated a concurrent induction of high magnitude CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses which were TH-1 dominant against the RBD and the remainder of the full spike glycoprotein. Full information on previously released data can be found here. For further information about the ongoing Phase 3 trial, visit www.ClinicalTrials.gov using the number NCT04368728.

About the EMA’s Rolling Review

Normally, all data on an investigational medicine’s efficacy, safety and quality and all required documents must be submitted at the start of the evaluation in a complete application for marketing authorization. In the case of a rolling review, the EMA’s CHMP reviews data as they become available from ongoing studies, before a complete application is submitted. Once the CHMP decides that sufficient data are available, the complete application should be submitted by the company. By reviewing the data as they become available, the CHMP can reach its opinion sooner on whether or not the investigational medicine or vaccine should be authorized. After a positive opinion, if adopted by the CHMP, it is the European Commission’s role to grant a Marketing Authorization.",1,t2_iqutg,2020-10-06 17:55:04,/r/COVID19/comments/j626l3/biontech_and_pfizer_initiate_rolling_submission/g7vq5p3/,0

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j5juhf,t1_g7vkzqj,g7vr4ws,"While it is too early to be 100% sure on how long immunity lasts what we have seen is reinfection is still very uncommon so far. This leads us to believe immunity lasts at least 6 months on average.

In addition phase 1 and 2 vaccine trial data indicated a stronger immune response  on average than people who were naturally infected, so from what i have read there is a decent level of confidence immunity will last 12 months at minimum (though again, we can't asses long term immunity for a disease that has only existed for 10 months) 

Finally what we know about infectious diseases, is there is not a black and white immune/ not immune. It is highly likely that  after infection or vaccination any subsequent infection would be more mild on average even if it took place over a year later. Your body learns how to fight the infection even if antibodies are no longer present. 

This plus there is 200 vaccines in development, if the early ones only provide 6-12 months of strong immunity there will be plenty of additional chances to get a better one. 

Basically, there is no way to answer your questions 100% simply because not enough time has past. That said there is no reason to believe the worse case is likely given previous diseases and  the fact that we have so many different vaccines in development.",1,t2_6nbjim7n,2020-10-06 18:13:37,/r/COVID19/comments/j5juhf/weekly_question_thread_week_of_october_05/g7vr4ws/,0
COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j62icy,t3_j62icy,g7vr7jt,"  “An Ongoing Infection Might Allow Persistent Activation of the Intrinsic Immune System”

“...Weisberg and colleagues and Jia and colleagues reported reduced severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody breadth, specificity, and neutralising activity in patients with MIS-C compared with patients with COVID-19 respiratory infection. Weisberg and colleagues postulated that ‘because younger individuals have increased number of naive T cells in different sites to respond to new pathogens, it is possible that a robust T cell response efficaciously clears infection in the lung preventing severe respiratory disease in children, and a LOW LEVEL, PERSISTENT INFECTION IN OTHER SITES may build up over time in some children, resulting in MIS-C’.

ACE-2 receptors are abundantly present in arterial and venous ENDOTHELIAL CELLS and arterial smooth muscle cells, and THE VASCULAR SYSTEM IS A POSSIBLE SIGHT OF PERSISTENT SARS-CoV-2 INFECTION. Colmenero and colleagues, in a study of seven children with chilblains, confirmed the presence of viral particles by immunohistiochemistry AND ELECTRON MICROSCOPY IN DERMAL VASCULAR ENDOTHELIUM. Similar to patients with MIS-C, these patients presented APPROXIMATELY 4 WEEKS AFTER THE PEAK of COVID-19 in their home region, had no personal history of acute COVID-19, and were NEGATIVE BY NASOPHARYNGEAL RT-PCR testing.

The report by Diorio and colleagues of extensive burr cells (ECHINOCYTES) in the peripheral blood smears of patients with MIS-C provides an additional clue to the pathophysiology of this recently described and unique syndrome. ACTIVATED MACROPHAGES induce nitrosative stress, which can induce echinocyte formation. Burr cell formation has also been reported in Epstein-Barr virus-triggered secondary HAEMOPHAGOCYTIC LYMPHOHISTIOCYTOSIS, and the tumour necrosis factor-α and INTERLEUKIN-10 ELEVATION described by the CHOP group is primarily produced by macrophage or monocyte lineages.

In MIS-C, immune responses that have not fully controlled an ONGOING INFECTION MIGHT ALLOW PERSISTENT ACTIVATION OF THE INTRINSIC IMMUNE SYSTEM. This persistent innate immune inflammatory response probably occurs because of THE ABILITY OF SARS-COV-2 TO BLOCK TYPE 1 AND TYPE 3 INTERFERON RESPONSE SIGNALLING TO THE ADAPTIVE IMMUNE SYSTEM WITHOUT DISRUPTING CYTOKINE PRODUCTION...

... this finding might also have important implications for antiviral treatment of ADULTS WITH PROLONGED SYMPTOMS after SARS-CoV-2 infection.”",1,t2_8addjxln,2020-10-06 18:14:59,/r/COVID19/comments/j62icy/misc_postinfectious_syndrome_or_persistent/g7vr7jt/,0

The impressive results in Vietnam are lauded for example as an example of a government being very organised and proactive to keep the pandemic under control. Yet right across the border in Cambodia the death rate from coronavirus is also remarkably low, yet no one would argue that the Cambodian health system is something to emulate. In the case of SE Asia I suspect the theory that exposure to related and unknown coronaviruses giving cross immunity is plausible. Africa has similarly uneventful death rates despite the very diverse people, governments and health care systems and extensive contact with Chinese migrant workers in many places. The IFR in people under 50 in the west is similarly pretty low so younger demographics likely account for at least some of the lower death rates in the least developed countries.",1,t2_30ugs5wq,2020-10-06 18:27:15,/r/COVID19/comments/j60va4/who_believes_10_of_world_has_had_covid19_eyes/g7vrv9w/,0

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j61qry,t3_j61qry,g7vsp5h,"""In this study, we detected the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in cats in Wuhan during the COVID-19 outbreak with ELISA, VNT and western blot. A total of 102 cats were tested, 15 (14.7%) were positive for RBD based ELISA and 11 (10.8%) were further positive with VNT. These results demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 has infected cats in Wuhan, implying that this risk could also occur at other outbreak regions. In fact, it has been indeed successively reported that SARS-CoV-2 infected cats under natural conditions [14,21]. Retrospective investigation confirmed that all of ELISA positive sera were sampled after the outbreak, suggesting that the infection of cats could be due to the virus transmission from humans to cats. Certainly, it is still needed to be verified via investigating the SARS-CoV-2 infections before this outbreak in a wide range of sampling. At present, there is no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from cats to humans. However, a latest report shows that SARS-CoV-2 can transmit between cats via respiratory droplets [12]. Over all, some preventive measures are necessary for blocking the human-to-cat transmission or preventing the potential transmission risk of cats to other animals or humans.

Through analysing the background of the tested cats, we found that 4 of abandoned cats (9.8%), 4 of cats from pet hospitals (8.7%), and 3 of cats with patient owners (20%) were positive with VNT. Although the positive rate among different source cats had no significant differences, the three cats with the highest neutralization titres (1/1080, 1/360, and 1/360, respectively) were owned by COVID-19 patients. On the contrary, the sera collected from pet hospital cats and stray cats had neutralizing activity of 1/20–1/80, indicating that the high neutralization titres could be due to the close contact between cats and COVID-19 patients. In addition, our data demonstrated that the duration of neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2 is relatively transient in the infected cats. So, the low neutralization titres could also be due to the long-time interval between sample collection and actual infection date. Although the infection in stray cats was not fully understood, it is reasonable to speculate that these infections are probably due to the contact with SARS-CoV-2 polluted environment, or COVID-19 patients who fed the cats.""",1,t2_g1t74,2020-10-06 18:42:28,/r/COVID19/comments/j61qry/a_serological_survey_of_sarscov2_in_cat_in_wuhan/g7vsp5h/,0

I also wonder how much having an outdoor lifestyle impacts things. The vast majority of Cambodia's population is rural (76%), so they probably spend a lot of time outdoors, where the virus just doesn't spread the same way. A lot of Africa is pretty similar. And if the infectious dose does impact disease severity (not sure where things stand on that as I've fallen a bit behind on reading), and being outdoors generally reduces that, we could be seeing an interaction there.

I do not see how this can happen.

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j65kpm,t3_j65kpm,g7w8tti,"**Abstract**


**Background**: It is clear that in UK healthcare workers, COVID-19 infections and deaths were more likely to be in staff who were of BAME origin. This has led to much speculation about the role of vitamin D in healthcare worker COVID-19 infections. We aimed to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in NHS staff who have isolated with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and relate this to vitamin D status.

**Methods**: We recruited NHS healthcare workers between 12th to 22nd May 2020 as part of the COVID-19 convalescent immunity study (COCO). We measured anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibodies using a combined IgG, IgA and IgM ELISA (The Binding Site). Vitamin D status was determined by measurement of serum 25(OH)D3 using the AB SCIEX Triple Quad 4500 mass spectrometry system. 

**Findings**: Of the 392 NHS healthcare workers, 214 (55%) had seroconverted for COVID-19. A total of 61 (15·6%) members of staff were vitamin D deficient (&lt;30 nmol/l) with significantly more staff from BAME backgrounds or in a junior doctor role being deficient. Vitamin D levels were lower in those who were younger, had a higher BMI (&gt;30 kg/m2), and were male. Multivariate analysis revealed that BAME and COVID-19 seroconversion were independent predictors of vitamin D deficiency. Staff who were vitamin D deficient were more likely to self-report symptoms of body aches and pains but importantly not the respiratory symptoms of cough and breathlessness. Vitamin D levels were lower in those COVID-19 positive staff who reported fever, but this did not reach statistical significance. Within the whole cohort there was an increase in seroconversion in staff with vitamin D deficiency compared to those without vitamin D deficiency (n=44/61, 72% vs n=170/331, 51%; p=0· 003); this was particularly marked in the proportion of BAME males who were vitamin D deficient compared to non-vitamin D deficient BAME males (n=17/18, 94% vs n=12/23, 52%; p=0·005).

**Background:** SARS-CoV-2 is found in conjunctival swabs and tears of COVID-19 patients. However, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 has not been detected in the human eye to date. We undertook this study to analyze the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in human post-mortem ocular tissues.


**Methods**: The expression of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was assessed by RT-PCR in corneal and scleral tissues from 33 surgical-intended donors who were eliminated from a surgical use per Eye Bank Association of America (EBAA) donor screening guidelines or medical director review or positive COVID-19 test. Ocular levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (RT-PCR), Envelope and Spike proteins (immunohistochemistry) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies (ELISA) in blood were evaluated in 10 COVID-19 donors. 


**Findings**: Of 132 ocular tissues from 33 surgical-intended donors, the positivity rate for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was ~13% (17/132). Of 10 COVID-19 donors, six had PCR positive post-mortem nasopharyngeal swabs whereas eight exhibited positive post-mortem anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels. Among 20 eyes recovered from 10 COVID-19 donors: three conjunctival, one anterior corneal, five posterior corneal, and three vitreous swabs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. SARS-CoV-2 spike and envelope proteins were detected in epithelial layer of the corneas that were procured without Povidone-Iodine (PVP-I) disinfection. 


**Interpretations**: Our study showed a small but noteworthy prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in ocular tissues from COVID-19 donors. These findings underscore the criticality of donor screening guidelines, post-mortem nasopharyngeal PCR testing and PVP-I disinfection protocol to eliminate any tissue harboring SARS-CoV-2 being used for corneal transplantation.",1,t2_i57f2,2020-10-06 23:00:00,/r/COVID19/comments/j66izu/prevalence_of_sarscov2_in_human_postmortem_ocular/g7wezb8/,0

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j66djc,t3_j66djc,g7wgkj6,"## Abstract

The  novel human coronavirus-2 (HCoV-2), called SARS-CoV-2, is the causative  agent of Coronavirus Induced Disease (COVID-19) and has spread causing a  global pandemic. Currently, there is no vaccine to prevent infection  nor any approved drug for the treatment. The development of a new drug  is time-consuming and cannot be relied on as a solution in combatting  the immediate global challenge. In such a situation, the drug  repurposing becomes an attractive solution to identify the potential of  COVID-19 treatment by existing drugs, which are approved for other  indications. Here, we review the potential use of rapamycin, an mTOR  (Mammalian Target of Rapamycin) inhibitor that can be repurposed at low  dosages for the treatment of COVID-19. Rapamycin inhibits protein  synthesis, delays aging, reduces obesity in animal models, and inhibits  activities or expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2,  IL-6 and, IL-10. Overall, the use of rapamycin can help to control viral  particle synthesis, cytokine storms and contributes to fight the  disease by its anti-aging and anti-obesity effects. Since, rapamycin  targets the host factors and not viral machinery, it represents a potent  candidate for the treatment of COVID-19 than antiviral drugs as its  efficacy is less likely to be dampened with high mutation rate of viral  RNA. Additionally, the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on cell  proliferation may aid in reducing viral replication. Therefore, by drug  repurposing, low dosages of rapamycin can be tested for the potential  treatment of COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 infection.",1,t2_kzxzr,2020-10-06 23:13:44,/r/COVID19/comments/j66djc/rapamycin_as_a_potential_repurpose_drug_candidate/g7wgkj6/,0

Overall, 374 (23%) patients allocated to lopinavir–ritonavir and 767 (22%) patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 1·03, 95% CI 0·91–1·17; p=0·60). Results were consistent across all prespecified subgroups of patients. We observed no significant difference in time until discharge alive from hospital (median 11 days [IQR 5 to &gt;28] in both groups) or the proportion of patients discharged from hospital alive within 28 days (rate ratio 0·98, 95% CI 0·91–1·05; p=0·53). Among patients not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, there was no significant difference in the proportion who met the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (risk ratio 1·09, 95% CI 0·99–1·20; p=0·092).
Interpretation
In patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with reductions in 28-day mortality, duration of hospital stay, or risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death.

Lol what? In clinical medicine with no RCT data you should generalize and assume *as little as possible,* particularly when dealing with a novel virus and - effectively - a novel treatment! Don't pretend you're saying that from a position of scientific or clinical authority!

That's not an argument to not do RCTs, *at all*. It's an (extremely strong) argument to do a number of RCTs for different settings, *precisely because you shouldn't generalize (!)*.

My point, if you reread my statement, is that at present CP is being used willy nilly across the US, for all sorts of patients at different disease stages, precisely because no good RCTs exist.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses its spike (S) protein to mediate viral entry into host cells. Cleavage of the S protein at the S1/S2 and/or S2′ site is known to activate the S protein for viral entry, which can occur at either the cell plasma membrane or the endosomal membrane. Previous studies show that SARS-CoV-2 has a unique insert at the S1/S2 site that can be cleaved by furin, which expands viral tropism to lung cells. Here, we analyze the presence of a furin S1/S2 site in related CoVs and offer thoughts on the implications of the unique insert the origin of SARS-CoV-2. We also utilized viral pseudoparticles to study the impact of the S1/S2 cleavage on infectivity. Our results demonstrate that S1/S2 pre-cleavage is essential for plasma membrane entry into Calu-3 cells, a model lung epithelial cell line, but not for endosomal entry Vero E6 cells, a model cell culture line, and that other proteases in addition to furin are responsible for processing SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2.",1,t2_16fdipyl,2020-10-06 23:44:16,/r/COVID19/comments/j67dhr/proteolytic_activation_of_the_sarscov2_spike_s1s2/g7wk8go/,0

This academic comment is meant to counter the sort of misinterpretation of scientific findings you often see in mass media. Scientists are generally recalcitrant to authoritatively state ""immunity will last this long, in this form"" and instead rely on the data they have and say things like, ""we see declines of this much in 3 months, this could mean it's short-lived"". But here they say, please, consider the basics of immunology when making and interpreting these statements:

And this comment also should help fill in your understanding, in that a negative serum antibody test is not equal to zero immunity:

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j68png,t3_j68png,g7wssto,"**Background**: COVID-19 may lead to an excessive inflammatory response resulting in cardiopulmonary complications and lung injury. Fluvoxamine might prevent this clinical deterioration through its action on the sigma1 receptor, which can down-regulate cytokine production.


**Methods**: Stop COVID was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, fully-remote (contactless) clinical trial of fluvoxamine. Participants included 152 adult outpatients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with symptom onset within 7 days. They were randomized to receive fluvoxamine 100mg (n=80), or placebo (n=72), three times daily for 15 days. The primary outcome was clinical deterioration over 15 days, defined by meeting both of the following: (1) shortness of breath and/or hospitalization for shortness of breath or pneumonia; (2) oxygen saturation &lt;92% on room air or need for supplemental oxygen to achieve oxygen saturation ≥92%.


**Results**: 152 participants were randomized in the modified intention to treat group. No patients (0/80, 0%) in the fluvoxamine group clinically deteriorated, compared to 8.3% (6/72) in the placebo group (log- rank chi-square 6.8, p=0.009).


**Conclusions**: Outpatients treated with fluvoxamine early in the course of symptomatic COVID-19 had a lower likelihood of clinical deterioration over 15 days. Due to the small sample size and short follow-up duration, larger randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm clinical efficacy.",2,t2_i57f2,2020-10-07 00:55:32,/r/COVID19/comments/j68png/fluvoxamine_for_prevention_of_clinical/g7wssto/,0

Among the non-treated patients, only 3% were admitted to the ICU.

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j5queo,t1_g7v1c0e,g7x4dzl,"The droplets don't ""float"".

The reason small droplets, say about 5 micron or less, remain suspended in the air is for two reasons.

One because they have a very small inertia. This means their particle response time to surrounding air fluctuations is very small and their Stokes number, regardless of however strong or weak the air motion is, is typically very small. Particles and droplets with a very small Stokes number follow the air motion very well. You will typically have random air fluctuations in all directions and therefore smaller droplets, which respond very well to these fluctuations, remain suspended for longer.

Another reason is that small sized droplets (particularly those less than one micron) are significantly influenced by Brownian motion. This is not the case for larger droplets.

Buoyancy forces are typically ignored in simulations when simplifying the equation of motion (BBO equation) for small particles/droplets in air because the density of the particles/droplets is significantly higher than that of the air.

You should not use the term ""lighter"". ""Light"" particles specifically refers to a situation where the particle density is lower than that of the surrounding fluid. This leads to different dynamical behaviour, and in this case buoyancy forces are important and cannot be ignored. The droplets/particles in in covid-19 case should be called ""heavy"" or ""dense"" because their density is greater than the surrounding fluid medium, which in this case is air.

In cases where the density of the particle and surrounding fluid medium is similar, we call the particles ""neutrally buoyant"".

You really should be careful saying it is a continuum. You can in some sense, but the reason you need to be careful is because as I said earlier, it depends on the Stokes number. This is effectively a ratio of the particle inertia to a characteristic time scale of the flow, typically either the Kolmogorov scale or an integral scale when the air flow is even nominally turbulent. You can also use basic engineering calculations like pipe diameter/centre pipe velocity to estimate a time scale or room diameter/typical room air velocity. There is no agreement as to what the fluid time scale should be. The Stokes number is there only to give a qualitative picture of how the particles/droplets disperse (relative to particular eddies in the flow).

Also note that particularly large droplets will deform in the air, leading to non-spherical shape and more complex dynamics. You may need to use an equivalent particle diameter. Literature in both simulations and experiments for non-spherical particles droplets is more scarce than spherical counterparts. Even with particles which are never truly spherical, you assume they are for simplicity.  


Another issue is that for sprays (or clouds of droplets as is the case of the covid-19 droplets) which have a range of droplet sizes, you will have a range of stokes numbers, so it isn't necessarily clear which Stokes number best describes the entire spray or cloud and therefore it makes it more difficult to characterise the dispersion.",1,t2_u4eo87j,2020-10-07 02:17:20,/r/COVID19/comments/j5queo/airborne_transmission_of_sarscov2/g7x4dzl/,0

""Two ship-based outbreaks reporting cumulative attack rates of 67.9% and 85.2% are inconsistent with high levels of pre-existing immunity to infection in the on-board populations""

Using PCR for those in a tight space, even with preexisting immunity, will still be able to pick up the present viral load.  PCR can find RNA even when it does not penetrate your passive immune system but dies in the nasal mucous.  PCR is wholly unsuited to determining infection, illness, or contagiousness, merely exposure to the disease.  To determine infection, you must actually culture live virus.

Given 2/3 of the sailors on the aircraft carrier were asymptomatic, it is extremely likely there was preexisting immunity.


Edit:  additionally:

&gt; Second, under scenarios 1–3 as described above, T cell immunity does not prevent infection but, rather, can modulate the time course of disease and infectiousness. Therefore, cross-immunity of this sort is not immunity to infection and is not expected to ‘supplement’ herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

If the disease is less infectious with decreased viral load, decreased symptoms, decreased contagiousness, it will spread more slowly and thus DOES impact the herd immunity threshold.",3,t2_86vzmbbe,2020-10-07 02:36:30,/r/COVID19/comments/j69ubq/crossreactive_memory_t_cells_and_herd_immunity_to/g7x72r7/,0

 - What is the likelihood COVID carries each specific target long-term effect?
 - What is the consequence of that effect?

For example, suppose we're analyzing the effect: ""cardiac involvement due to COVID causes long-term cardiac sequelae."" If the likelihood is 1-in-1000 that this is true, but the consequence is that 1-in-3 infectees lose a median of 15 years of life, that's still pretty severe overall. If the likelihood is 1-in-100000, not so much. 

Putting numbers to these things -- even gesturally -- reveals that while you may be right (and are increasingly likely to be by the day), we definitely don't know enough to act that way on a policy level. There's still too much room on the likelihood side, and still too much noise on the consequence side, to make any clear-cut social decision.

There was no past medical history of gastric bypass, bariatric surgery, small bowel resection,
chronic pancreatitis, malabsorption syndromes, or prior
history of vitamin C intake. His home medications included
lantus, sitagliptin, metoprolol, amlodipine, HAART regi-
men, and allopurinol. Initial temperature was 101.9 °F, pulse
was 76 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 26 breaths per
minute, Blood Pressure was 132/72 mm Hg, and O2 satura-
tion was 96% on 4 L/m oxygen. See Table 1 for laboratory
results on presentation. He was started on broad-spectrum
antibiotics and COVID-19 RNA polymerase chain reaction
was positive. Chest X-ray revealed airspace opacity in the
right upper lobe, peripheral right lower lobe, and left perihi-
lar area. Computed tomography angiogram of the chest had
no evidence of pulmonary embolism, but multifocal bilateral
diffuse ground glass opacities were seen. He had worsening
respiratory status and increasing oxygen needs and was
eventually placed on non-rebreather oxygen and transferred
to the intensive care unit within 24 hours of admission. He
was treated with IV solumedrol, zinc, and vitamin C 3 g
every 6 hours from hospital admission day 2 through 9 (total
vitamin C dose 84 g). Initial urine studies had new protein-
uria and hematuria (Table 1). He had acute kidney injury
(AKI) with worsening azotemia, oliguria, and renal ultra-

ated on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) due to
anuric AKI with metabolic acidosis. CRRT with Oxiris filter
(Baxter International Orixis filter, emergency use authoriza-
tion by the Food and Drug Association to reduce pro-inflam-

&gt;125 of 143 Italian patients ranging in **age from 19 to 84 years** still experienced physician-confirmed COVID-19–related symptoms an average of **2 months** after their first symptom emerged. **All had been hospitalized**, with their stays averaging about 2 weeks; **80% hadn’t received any form of ventilation.**

Small `n` in that study, but that's 87.4% (125/143) hospitalizations that are potential long-haulers.

&gt;Overall, **approximately 10% of people who’ve had COVID-19 experience prolonged symptoms**, a UK team estimated in a recently published Practice Pointer on postacute COVID-19 management. And yet, the authors wrote, primary care physicians have little evidence to guide their care.

This seems to track pretty well elsewhere, too.  ([12.7% in Canada](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/epidemiological-summary-covid-19-cases.html), [178/100k pop | 13.5% of cases in the US](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html))

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j6brwj,t3_j6brwj,g7xezci,"&gt;The potential aerosolised transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 is of global concern. Airborne precaution personal protective equipment and preventative measures are universally mandated for medical procedures deemed to be aerosol‐generating. The implementation of these measures is having a huge impact on healthcare provision. There is currently a lack of quantitative evidence on the number and size of airborne particles produced during aerosol‐generating procedures to inform risk assessments. To address this evidence gap, we conducted real‐time, high‐resolution environmental monitoring in ultraclean ventilation operating theatres during tracheal intubation and extubation sequences. Continuous sampling with an optical particle sizer allowed characterisation of aerosol generation within the zone between the patient and anaesthetist. Aerosol monitoring showed a very low background particle count (0.4 particles.l‐1) allowing resolution of transient increases in airborne particles associated with airway management. A positive reference control quantitated the aerosol produced in the same setting by a volitional cough (average concentration, 732 (418) particles.l‐1, n = 38). Tracheal intubation including face‐mask ventilation produced very low quantities of aerosolised particles (average concentration, 1.4 (1.4) particles.l‐1, n = 14, p &lt; 0·0001 vs. cough). Tracheal extubation, particularly when the patient coughed, produced a detectable aerosol (21 (18) l‐1, n = 10) which was 15‐fold greater than intubation (p = 0.0004) but 35‐fold less than a volitional cough (p &lt; 0.0001). The study does not support the designation of elective tracheal intubation as an aerosol‐generating procedure. Extubation generates more detectable aerosol than intubation but falls below the current criterion for designation as a high risk aerosol‐generating procedure. These novel findings from real‐time aerosol detection in a routine healthcare setting provide a quantitative methodology for risk assessment that can be extended to other airway management techniques and clinical settings. They also indicate the need for reappraisal of what constitutes an aerosol‐generating procedure and the associated precautions for routine anaesthetic airway management.",1,t2_cj5j6,2020-10-07 03:31:43,/r/COVID19/comments/j6brwj/a_quantitative_evaluation_of_aerosol_generation/g7xezci/,0

In addition, the guidance provides recommendations regarding key information and data that should be submitted to a relevant investigational new drug application (IND) or cross-referenced master file (MF) prior to submission of an EUA request in order to facilitate FDA’s complete and timely review of such a submission, including convening the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC). This guidance also discusses FDA’s current thinking regarding the circumstances under which the issuance of an EUA for a COVID-19 vaccine would be appropriate, providing additional context to the discussion regarding EUAs in the guidance for industry entitled “Development and Licensure of Vaccines to Prevent COVID-19” (Ref. 1).

*""The CRP-PCR test* \[a test for endemic CoV infection\] *was more frequently ordered while patients were at a hospital (inpatient, observation unit, or emergency department) in the eCoV- as compared to eCoV+ patients""*

*""The last documented CRP-PCR result prior to the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test occurred significantly more recently in the eCoV+ (****median 121 days..****) as compared to the eCoV- (****median 359 days..)****, The eCoV+ as compared to eCoV- patients also had significantly more frequent CRP-PCR testing""*

From the above 2 excerpts, my take is that eCoV+ group will include people with faster, better access to health care...  who perhaps have more financial means, are more proactive seeking tests and treatments, and choose physicians who meet their needs.  It will include those for instance who will get a swab every time they get a cold(!!)

Surely such a group are likely to present earlier for Sars-CoV-2 swabs too, and they are perhaps admitted to hospital at an earlier stage as well in order to access supplemental oxygen.

If so, then the following 2 excerpts are no surprise;

*""The frequency of documented SARS-CoV-2 infection among those tested, and of hospitalization among those infected, did not differ between the eCoV+ and eCoV- groups""*

""*The eCoV+ as compared to eCoV- hospitalized patients had a significantly lower odds for intensive care unit (ICU) admission""*

(I suspect that those in the eCoV- group were more often admitted at a later stage of disease)

Also, the discrepancy in those periods between CRP-PCR and Sars-CoV-2 PCR (**121 days v 359 days!!**) surely waters down any claim that cross-reactive immunity from a recent eCoV infection was beneficial.",1,t2_5zu9thqe,2020-10-07 07:30:42,/r/COVID19/comments/j6ca8q/recent_endemic_coronavirus_infection_is/g7y7k5a/,0

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j6adac,t1_g7xz6bm,g7yg40r,"An ""antigen"" is something our immune system detects as a threat that needs to be responded to.  What that is saying is that the spike protein on this virus may be especially effective at stimulating the kind of immune response that causes inflammation.

Some useful context that may help you is that inflammatory immune response is mainly effective at fighting bacteria and fungal infections, not virus.  There's a different kind of immune response that fights viruses.  Antigens stimulate the immune system to do both kinds, generally.  One of the things we're learning about SARS-CoV-2 is that it has some very well-developed mechanisms to evade and tamp down the antiviral immune response.  At the same time, it stimulates a lot of inflammatory immune response, which gets out of control in part because the virus isn't being effectively fought by the antiviral components of the immune system.  It may be that the inflammatory immune response is the main component of the disease covid-19, rather than the activity of the virus directly.

Vaccines... there are a bunch of different ones designed around different ideas.  So you'd have to be more specific about what sort of vaccine.  A good vaccine may be designed to trigger antiviral responses, before the virus comes in, which would keep both the virus and the immune system under control.

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j6k7te,t3_j6k7te,g7z0cc4,"""Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of COVID-19 confirmed hospitalized patients treated with or without montelukast. We used “clinical deterioration” as the primary endpoint, a binary outcome defined as any increase in the Ordinal Scale value from Day 1 to Day 3 of hospital stay, as these data were uniformly available for all admitted patients before hospital discharge. Rates of clinical deterioration between the montelukast and non-montelukast groups were compared using the Fisher’s exact test. Univariate logistic regression was also used to assess the association between montelukast use and clinical deterioration.

Results:A total of 92 patients were analyzed, 30 received montelukast at the discretion of the treating physician and 62 patients who did not receive montelukast. Patients receiving montelukast experienced significantly fewer events of clinical deterioration compared to patients not receiving montelukast (10% vs 32%, p = 0.022). Sensitivity analysis among those without asthma showed a trend toward fewer clinical deterioration events in the montelukast group than non-montelukast groups (11% vs 33%, p = 0.077). Sensitivity analysis among those who did not receive azithromycin showed fewer clinical deterioration events in the montelukast group vs. non-montelukast groups (8% vs 32%, p = 0.030).

Conclusions:Our findings suggest that montelukast associates with a reduction in clinical deterioration for COVID-19 confirmed patients as measured on the COVID-19 Ordinal Scale. Montelukast may have activity in COVID-19 infection, and future efforts should evaluate this potential therapy.""",2,t2_32hiujhs,2020-10-07 12:09:35,/r/COVID19/comments/j6k7te/montelukast_in_hospitalized_patients_diagnosed/g7z0cc4/,0

&gt; Since  furin  treatment  only  modestly  increased  infectivity in  all  cases  observed,  we wanted  to visualize how efficiently furin was processing the SARS-CoV-2 S. For **cleaved** particles, exogeneous furin was able to fully reduce the faint full-length S bandinto S2(Figure 4C, lanes 1 and 2). For **uncleaved** particles, furin treatment had no observable impact, as the intensity of the full-length S bands are the same and there are no additional bands shown between furin treated and non-treated particles(Figure 4C, lanes 3 and 4). Additional bandsat &gt;185 kDa likely corresponding to dimeric and trimeric S20.  
  
I think this is a typo and they are swapped; in the previous paragraph they describe the evidence the opposite way around.  
This is also in conflict with the study posted a few days ago showing inhibiting furin reduced SARS-2 replication in-vitro.  
  
&gt; Interestingly,  the  S1/S2  site  activation  appears  to  also  have  a  role  in  the  immune  response against SARS-CoV-2, as it has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 S with a deleted S1/S2 loop can provide better protective immune response than with the S1/S2 loop^(36).  
  
&gt; The  role  of  furinin  activating  the  S1/S2  site  was  also  investigated.  As  protease  inhibitors  commonly employed in cell entry studies, such as dec-RVKR-CMK, can also inhibit other PCs in addition to furin31, it is difficult to ascertain the impact of individual proteases. While furinlikelycanprocess the SARS-CoV-2site,  our  data  suggests  that  otherPCs  are also involved,  since Western  blots  show  poor  processing  of uncleaved  Supon  addition  of  purified  furinandalso  theuse  of  a highly  selective furin  inhibitor  has  a modest impacton infectivity. As we consider protease-based inhibitors in treating COVID-19, especially those targeting furin37, it is important to thoroughly consider evaluate the role of these proteasesto be certain that the relevant proteases are targeted.

1. In this Nature publication, investigators looked at rectal swabs for their cohort of 10 asymptomatic kids. Rectal swabs were positive in 8 of them and rectal swab positivity persisted beyond pharyngeal swabs in all 8.

[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0817-4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0817-4)

2. In this Gastroenterology Journal publication, investigators looked at n=401 cases who were positive on pharyngeal swabs and 80 had positive rectal swabs.  
The rectal positivity rate in those &gt; 18 y was 16.98% but in paediatric pts (&lt; 18 y) was **56.67%**!  
There was no difference in GIT symptoms, whether rectal swabs were positive or negative.

I'm gobsmacked as to why there has been so little interest in rectal or faecal PCR. I suspect that purely GI Covid is very mild/asymptomatic, will not necessarily show up on throat swabs, and is likely to be a dead-end transmission (\*outside of slums!)

And with limited resources those have to be prioritized. But prioritizing only a small set of procedures never made much sense. 

Coughing, talking and deep breathing all generate aerosols. Even normal breathing at rest does, and depending on viral shedding rate, proximity, contact time, PPE and ventilation that might be enough to cause infection. Probably better to assess the risk based on proximity and time than fixating on ‘aerosol generating procedures’ as if aerosols aren’t being generated all the time. And extend aerosol precautions to a wider set of activities and with more recognition that workers and patients without symptoms or only mild symptoms might be the most infectious of all since viral load peaks around the onset of symptoms.

There's a mountain of contact tracing data, which supports this: Only rarely the infections happen even though dozens of kids are exposed. 

On the other hand contact tracing data with young adults shows that mass exposure leads to some amount of infections.

The differences from contact tracing are stark between ages 20-29 and 0-10. Ages 10-20 fall somewhere in between and it seems the transmission effectiveness grows with ages in that age bracket.

This does not mean that the transmission does not happen with younger kids. It does. It just looks like it is much less likely.

However, most people are comfortable with the small risk and schools and day cares function normally despite the ongoing epidemic. 

In the US the narratives seem to be massively polarized and exaggerated in both directions. This polarizing conflict prevents rational planning and optimal choices.

Background: Given the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the occurrence of a second wave, assessing the burden of disease among health care workers (HCWs) is crucial. We aim to document the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG among HCWs in Belgian hospitals, and to study potential risk factors for the infection in order to guide infection prevention and control (IPC) measures in healthcare institutions. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the baseline results (April 22 - April 26) of an ongoing cohort study. All staff who were present in the hospital during the sampling period and whose profession involved contact with patients were eligible. Fourteen hospitals across Belgium and 50 HCW per hospital were randomly selected. RT-qPCR was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA on nasopharyngeal swabs, and a semi-quantitative IgG ELISA was used to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in sera. Individual characteristics likely to be associated with seropositivity were collected using an online questionnaire. Findings: 698 participants completed the questionnaire; 80.8% were women, median age was 39.5, and 58.5% were nurses. Samples were collected on all 699 participants. The weighted anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence was 7.7% (95%CI, 4.7%-12.2%), while 1.1% (95%CI, 0.4%-3.0%) of PCR results were positive. Unprotected contact with a confirmed case was the only factor associated with seropositivity (PR 2.16, 95% CI, 1.4-3.2). Interpretation: Most Belgian HCW did not show evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection by late April 2020, and unprotected contact was the most important risk factor. This confirms the importance of widespread availability of protective equipment and use of adequate IPC measures in hospital settings.",1,t2_1jopkpkc,2020-10-07 16:51:23,/r/COVID19/comments/j65eix/sarscov2_prevalence_and_seroprevalence_among/g7zhxz5/,0

&gt;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is causing substantial mortality, morbidity and societal disruption (Tay et al., 2020, Vabret et al., 2020) and effective vaccines and therapeutics may take several months or years to become available. A substantial number of patients become life-threateningly ill, and the mechanisms responsible for causing severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) in COVID-19 are not well understood. Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand the key players driving protective and pathogenic immune responses in COVID-19 (Vabret et al., 2020). This knowledge may help devise better therapeutics and vaccines for tackling the current pandemic. CD4+ T cells are key orchestrators of anti-viral immune responses, either by enhancing the effector functions of other immune cell types like cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, NK cells and B cells or through direct killing of infected cells (Sallusto, 2016). Recent studies in patients with COVID-19 have verified the presence of CD4+ T cells that are reactive to SARS-CoV-2 (Braun et al., 2020, Thieme et al., 2020, Grifoni et al., 2020). However, the nature and types of CD4+ T cell subsets that respond to SARS-CoV-2 and the roles these subsets play in driving protective or pathogenic immune responses remain elusive. Here, we have analyzed single-cell transcriptomes of virus-reactive CD4+ T cells to determine associations with severity of COVID-19 illness, and to compare the molecular properties of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells to other common respiratory virus-reactive CD4+ T cells from healthy control subjects.",1,t2_tqp6q,2020-10-07 17:29:21,/r/COVID19/comments/j6avxt/imbalance_of_regulatory_and_cytotoxic/g7zjr19/,0

Four different endemic coronaviruses (eCoVs) are etiologic agents for the seasonal “common cold,” and these eCoVs share extensive sequence homology with human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we show that individuals with as compared to without a relatively recent documented eCoV were tested at greater frequency for respiratory infections but had similar rate of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition. Importantly, the patients with a previously detected eCoV had less severe coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) illness.

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j6jd6z,t1_g7zxfev,g7zz7bc,"yeah, it does look a bit suspicious. Coincidentally Drosten talked about losing hope on cross immunity from older coronoviruses. Here are the interesting parts (auto-translated):

When asked about cross reactivity:

&gt; This is only a fragmentary reaction. And now you can go even further. For example, you could say: Let's take the T-cells from patients - whether SARS-infected or not SARS-infected, from anybody - which react against the proteins from the cold corona viruses. Now we are not testing against the SARS-2 virus, but against cold corona viruses. And what we see here is interesting. So when we prepare these cells - I say this now because it is really high-tech, it is a very high analytical art to do this in the laboratory... So what the authors have done is: prepared T-cells that react against these cold coron-aviruses and they have also tested them again in their reaction mode. Then you see, interestingly enough: There is a cross-reactivity from one Alphacoronavirus to another Alphacoronavi-rus. So the human coronavirus 299E reacts cross-reactive against the human coronavirus NL63. And this also exists within the betacoronaviruses. So the human coronavirus OC43 reacts cross-reactively against the human coronavirus HKU1, but not between alpha- and betacoronavirus, not between the genera. This means that these viruses seem to be so far apart that there is no real one, relevant cross stimulation or cross-activity. And interestingly, this cross-activity against the SARS-2 virus does not exist at all.

&gt; Based on this finding, we can already estimate very well that there is probably little real cross-reactivity, cross-protection against the SARS-2 virus. And we can still do a cross-check. We can also prepare the cells of SARS-2 patients and stimulate them again against these human viruses, against human cold corona viruses and also against control viruses. And what we see is that the stimulation is relatively poor everywhere. It is also about as bad as against... So once we have gone through SARS-2, the knowledge or activation of these cells, which we then have against the human corona viruses, is relatively poor. And it is actually not much better than against influenza. So that's all in the background noise range. None of this really has anything to do with the viruses that we are studying here at all. In other words, it is highly unlikely that there is such a thing as a real cross-protection.

&gt; We can probably say, what one sees in these studies, is not evenly not a cross-immunity, but only a cross-activity, a cross-reactivity, how one may express that also always in words. Thus the cells make a signal, but that is surely not strong and active enough, in order to keep away really an infection from the body. So we probably cannot really speak of immunity. And this is of course a single finding in this study. There will have to be other studies to interpret that further. And the authors express themselves here very well and very cautiously. By the way, none of this means that a survived infection with SARS-2 does not lead to cellular immunity. We have not checked this at all here, but only the cross-activation.

&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic by non-stop infections of SARS-CoV-2 has continued to ravage many countries worldwide. Here we report the discovery of suramin, a 100-year-old drug, as a potent inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) through blocking the binding of RNA to the enzyme. In biochemical assays, suramin and its derivatives are at least 20-fold more potent than remdesivir, the currently approved nucleotide drug for COVID-19. The 2.6 Å cryo-EM structure of the viral RdRp bound to suramin reveals two binding sites of suramin, with one site directly blocking the binding of the RNA template strand and the other site clash with the RNA primer strand near the RdRp catalytic active site, therefore inhibiting the viral RNA replication. Furthermore, suramin potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 duplication in Vero E6 cells. These results provide a structural mechanism for the first non-nucleotide inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and a rationale for repurposing suramin for treating COVID-19.",1,t2_tqp6q,2020-10-07 22:20:35,/r/COVID19/comments/j6oxse/structural_basis_for_repurposing_a_100yearsold/g806e7i/,0

One comment that stuck in my mind was that he mentioned that it is still unclear of the clinical relevance (in vivo) of the T cell cross-reactivity. So the in vitro immunological assays demonstrate cross reactivity of common cold coronaviruses with SARS-COV-2. This could mean either: 

1/ They do provide some protection and while you will get infected by SARS-COV-2, you will get less severe disease or be asymptomatic.
2/ These T cell responses have no effect on SARS-COV-2 pathogenesis in vivo.
3/ These T cell responses may actually exacerbate SARS-COV-2 disease severity, the immune system is complicated.

The combination cohort enrolled recently diagnosed patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, who were assigned to 2800 mg of each antibody (n=112) or placebo (n=156).

&gt;The combination therapy significantly reduced viral load at day 11 (p=0.011), meeting the primary endpoint of the study. Most patients, including those receiving placebo, demonstrated near complete viral clearance by day 11. Further, combination treatment reduced viral levels at day 3 (p=0.016) and day 7 (p&lt;0.001)—earlier time points during the course of infection when higher viral loads are typically seen. Combination therapy also significantly reduced the time-weighted average change from baseline from day 1 to 11. An exploratory analysis showed that the proportion of patients with persistent high viral load at day 7 for combination therapy was lower (3.0 percent) versus placebo (20.8 percent), corresponding to a nominal p value of p&lt;0.0001 without multiplicity adjustment. No emergent putative resistance variants have been observed thus far in patients treated with combination therapy.

&gt;Combination therapy also met prespecified clinical endpoints, including the time-weighted average change from baseline in total symptom score from day 1 to 11 (p=0.009). The improvement in symptoms was observed as early as three days after dosing and was similar in magnitude and timing to improvements previously seen with LY-CoV555 monotherapy. The rate of COVID-related hospitalization and ER visits was lower for patients treated with combination therapy (0.9 percent) versus placebo (5.8 percent), a relative risk reduction of 84.5 percent (p=0.049). This was also similar to observations for LY-CoV555 monotherapy.

&gt;Combination therapy has been generally well tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events. In LY-CoV555 monotherapy studies there have been isolated drug-related infusion reactions or hypersensitivity that were generally mild (two reported as serious infusion reactions, all patients recovered). Treatment emergent adverse events were comparable to placebo for both LY-CoV555 monotherapy and combination therapy.

&gt;Lilly is working to publish the monotherapy and combination therapy data in peer-reviewed journals as soon as possible.",1,t2_i1evx,2020-10-07 22:49:11,/r/COVID19/comments/j6s4b6/lilly_provides_comprehensive_update_on_progress/g809mpu/,0
COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j6s8l3,t3_j6s8l3,g809x0j,"&gt; Abstract

&gt; Researchers believe that smoking might increase the severity of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 by altering the viability and integrity of the BBB, while promoting the expression of ACE2 in endothelial cells, glia, and neurons. Moreover, as smoking increases the blood circulatory level of VWF and decreases the levels of thrombomodulin, it can lead to dysregulated blood homeostasis and hence, increased risk of thrombosis which significantly increases the risk of stroke and cardiovascular disorders. However, despite current controversies and remarkable study limitations, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis claims that the findings of 18 recent COVID-19 clinical and epidemiological studies show that smokers were statistically less likely to be hospitalized. The authors state that their observations might be due to the effects of nicotine. We believe that the lower number of hospitalized smokers than expected, if confirmed by further studies, can be due to the higher concentration of deposited energy of alpha particles emitted from radionuclides such as Po-210 in cigarette tobacco. The anti-inflammatory effects of localized radiation energy deposition of alpha particles as well as the effect of low doses of radiation on reducing the risk of thrombosis, are possibly involved in the lower number of hospitalized smokers than expected. ",1,t2_6pit6qou,2020-10-07 22:51:37,/r/COVID19/comments/j6s8l3/why_do_some_reports_claim_that_the_number_of/g809x0j/,0

A wide spectrum of clinical manifestations has become a hallmark of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19 pandemic, although the immunological underpinnings of diverse disease outcomes remain to be defined. We performed detailed characterization of B cell responses through high-dimensional flow cytometry to reveal substantial heterogeneity in both effector and immature populations. More notably, critically ill patients displayed hallmarks of extrafollicular B cell activation and shared B cell repertoire features previously described in autoimmune settings. Extrafollicular activation correlated strongly with large antibody-secreting cell expansion and early production of high concentrations of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies. Yet, these patients had severe disease with elevated inflammatory biomarkers, multiorgan failure and death. Overall, these findings strongly suggest a pathogenic role for immune activation in subsets of patients with COVID-19. Our study provides further evidence that targeted immunomodulatory therapy may be beneficial in specific patient subpopulations and can be informed by careful immune profiling.",1,t2_505k49k6,2020-10-07 23:28:52,/r/COVID19/comments/j6sx2o/extrafollicular_b_cell_responses_correlate_with/g80ebwg/,0

We won't know any potential long term effects until we get to long term. For what it's worth, it'll probably be safe. But we won't know for sure until we know for sure, several years down the road. My concern is if it isn't. Once the thing is in you, you can't get it out, you know? 

I doubt this will be allowed, since it's a news source, but there's a polio outbreak happening now because of the polio vaccine. And it's been around *forever.*

https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/polio-outbreak-sudan-caused-oral-vaccine-72766683

And polio is nowhere *near* as nasty as covid. 

Then I look at the hpv vaccine, which we now know is safe. From the wikipedia source, the timelines. It was approved in 2006 by the fda (gardasil). It wasn't until 2014 that Gardasil 9 was approved for females from 9-26 and males from 9-15. I think it was only recently it became okay for everybody (I don't have an exact date, and this varies by country). 

Why the time lag? We knew it worked back in 2006. Why did it take 8 years or more to get approved for general use? If it worked back in 2006, by your logic (not trying to put words in your mouth), it should have been cleared for general use by 2007 at the latest, no? 

I'm not saying don't get the damn thing. I'm saying it's probably prudent to vaccinate the most at-risk and likely to die. Everybody else, maybe wait a bit, and see what happens before running to get a jab. I consider that prudent, and I'm guessing you don't. I don't understand why. 

Humans seem to be singularly unable (as a herd) to properly anticipate knock-on effects and assess the likelihood or severity. It's all about 'fix it now, and worry about later if later comes.'

A. Alwan Nature 584, 170; 2020).

As discussed earlier its known that vitamin C is very low in covid patients and these are all symptoms of scurvy:
&gt; In a forensic context, scurvy may mimic inflicted injuries and may be responsible for sudden death by mechanisms that remain unclear. Cardiac failure and rhythm disturbances with chest pain, hypotension, cardiac tamponade, and dyspnea are associated with vitamin C deficiency. In addition, syncope and seizures may occur.

&gt; [...]

&gt; The first manifestation of scurvy is lassitude with other psychological manifestations including depression, hypochondriasis, psychomotor retardation, “personality change,” and confusion, possibly associated with disturbances in the function of the basal motor nuclei.2,34 Estimates have varied among reports, with clinical symptoms and signs taking between 30 and 120 days to appear after vitamin C was ceased in the diet, with overt scurvy developing between 40 and 180 days.1,4 Weight loss occurs with bleeding manifestations.35https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30422823/

It was recently shown that the major genetic risk factor associated with becoming severely ill with COVID-19 when infected by SARS-CoV-2 is inherited from Neandertals. With increasing sample size, additional genetic associations with severe COVID-19 are now being discovered. The latest study of the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative finds five novel genome-wide associations with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. Here we show that a haplotype at one of these genomic regions is inherited from Neandertals. It encodes proteins that activate enzymes that are important during infections with RNA viruses. In contrast to the previously described Neandertal risk haplotype, this Neandertal haplotype is protective against severe COVID-19 but is of more moderate effect than the risk haplotype",2,t2_f7k1phj,2020-10-08 01:13:37,/r/COVID19/comments/j6uwgp/a_genetic_variant_protective_for_covid19_is/g80r2v4/,0

Semmelweis University (SE) has been involved in testing a new diagnostic procedure, a one-step PCR test that detects coronavirus faster and easier, the medical university informed MTI on Wednesday.



 Barna Vásárhelyi, director of the Institute of Laboratory Medicine at Semmelweis University, said in a statement that classical PCR testing is based on RNA detection of virus extracted from a sample.
     RNA extraction requires a time-consuming, costly process that takes several hours, a reagent, and a dedicated professional.  In addition, manufacturing companies are often unable to deliver the reagent in the right amount and on time, he added.
     That is why there is a huge need for a test that does not require RNA to be extracted, but to detect the virus directly from the sample taken, he pointed out.  Barna Vásárhelyi stated that the newly developed, one-step RT-PCR test had been tested and the results obtained were completely identical to the results of the classical PCR tests.
     The announcement quotes Rector Béla Merkely, who said that the tests performed with the new Hungarian-developed test will yield results faster, tie up less specialist capacity and are expected to be more cost-effective, so SE will use these tests in increasing numbers in the future.
     Semmelweis University from Hungary participated in the testing of the new diagnostic procedure.
     The test, called AzureSeq, was developed by the Hungarian-owned molecular diagnostics company Omixon Biocomputing Kft. - in cooperation with SeqOnce Bioscience in California - and has exclusive distribution rights in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

degrees of scaling (Fig 2a). Some had been described as similar to pityriasis rosea. Purpura may
also be present, either punctiform or on larger areas. A few cases showed infiltrated papules in

Also, sudden decompensation upon exercise:
&gt; One of the striking observations in the older literature is of death being quite sudden in apparently stable individuals. One of the best descriptions of this was in a passage from Ansons’ A Voyage Around the World (1740–1744): “For many of our people, though confined to their hammocks, appeared to have no unconsiderable share of health; for they ate and drank heartily, were cheerful, and talked with much seeming vigor, and with a loud strong tone of voice; and yet on being the least moved, though it was only from one part of the ship to the other, and that in their hammocks, they have immediately expired. And others, who have confided in their seeming strength, and have resolved to get out of their hammocks, have died before they could well reach the deck. And it was no uncommon thing for these who would do some kind of duty, and walk the deck, to drop down dead in an instant on any endeavors to act with their utmost vigour.” 42 Lind also commented that “they are apt, upon being moved, or exposed to fresh air, suddenly to expire.” 4 It is recorded that only 4 men died from enemy action during Anson’s voyage, with more than 1300 dying of disease, which was primarily scurvy. 4

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j6su2i,t1_g80vfvd,g80zh11,"50% reduction in mortality in covid patients after 24 g IV vitamin C per day:

https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-52778/latest.pdf

Smaller studies on IV vitamin C for covid:

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32828741/

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32709838/


This is as expected, since Vitamin C requirements are much higher in sick people (including pneumonia):

&gt; Overall, the critically ill patients exhibited hypovitaminosis C (i.e., &lt; 23 μmol/L), with a mean plasma vitamin C concentration of 17.8 ± 8.7 μmol/L; of these, one-third had vitamin C deficiency (i.e., &lt; 11 μmol/L). Patients with hypovitaminosis C had elevated inflammation (C-reactive protein levels; P &lt; 0.05). The patients with septic shock had lower vitamin C concentrations and higher C-reactive protein concentrations than the non-septic patients (P &lt; 0.05). Nearly 40% of the septic shock patients were deficient in vitamin C, compared with 25% of the non-septic patients. These low vitamin C levels were apparent despite receiving recommended intakes via enteral and/or parenteral nutritional therapy (mean 125 mg/d). 

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29228951/

&gt; Our study confirms previous findings that intravenous doses of 2 to 3g/d are required to normalize vitamin-C plasma concentrations in critically ill patients . However, optimal plasma concentrations during overwhelming oxidative stress are not known, nor whether peaks are more effective than lower but stable plasma concentrations. Two recent studies using 100mg/kg/day and 6g/day as intermittent boluses in sepsis reported a reduction in mortality, but these findings as well as the dose-effect relationship need confirmation in larger randomized controlled trials15,16. 

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29522710/

&gt; Our study implies vitamin C hypovitaminosis or deficiency are common in septic shock patients and that 6-hourly dosing at 1.5 g intravenous of vitamin C achieves and maintains normal or supranormal vitamin C levels in patients with septic shock. The observation of an increase in volume of distribution in the multiple dose cohort (39.9 L) compared with the first-dose cohort (23.3 L) implies either changes in volume of distribution secondary to fluid resuscitation or other septic shock-associated mechanisms such as changes in vascular permeability.42,43 The observation that clearance was reduced in the multidose cohort implies either loss of renal clearance due to worsening function or decreased vitamin C consumption, as treatment with antibiotics decreased oxidative stress. 

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31778629/

&gt; Plasma vitamin C levels in all patients were subnormal at enrollment (&lt;28 μmol/L), with no significant difference between groups (median for vitamin C–infused patients vs placebo, 22 vs 22 μmol/L [interquartile range {IQR}, 8-39 vs 11-37]; P = .49). (To convert vitamin C to mg/dL, divide values by 56.78.) Plasma vitamin C levels sampled at trough periods before infusion had increased significantly in vitamin C–infused patients by hours 48 (median, 166 μmol/L; IQR, 88-376) and 96 (median, 169 μmol/L; IQR, 87-412) compared with placebo patients by hours 48 (median, 23 μmol/L; IQR, 9-37) and 96 (median, 26 μmol/L; IQR, 9-41) (Figure 3). At hour 168, plasma vitamin C level in placebo patients remained low (median, 29 μmol/L; IQR, 12-39). After cessation of vitamin C infusion at 96 hours, vitamin C levels declined but remained significantly elevated at hour 168 (median, 46 μmol/L; IQR, 19-66) compared with placebo 

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2752063

&gt; Correctly timed baseline vitamin C levels were available for 22 patients in the treatment group; the mean level was 14.1 +/- 11.8 uM (normal, 40-60 uM), with no patient having a normal level. 

https://journal.chestnet.org/article/S0012-3692(16)62564-3/fulltext



&gt; Patients with pneumonia had depleted vitamin C status compared with healthy controls (23 ± 14 μmol/L vs 56 ± 24 μmol/L, P &lt;0.001). The more severe patients in the ICU had significantly lower vitamin C status than those recruited through AMAU (11 ± 3 μ mol/L vs 24 ± 14 μmol/L, P = 0.02). The total pneumonia cohort comprised 62% with hypovitaminosis C and 22% with deficiency, compared with only 8% hypovitaminosis C and no cases of deficiency in the healthy controls. The pneumonia cohort also exhibited significantly elevated protein carbonyl concentrations compared with the healthy controls (P &lt; 0.001), indicating enhanced oxidative stress in the patients. We were able to collect subsequent samples form 28% of the cohort (mean 2.7 ± 1.7 days; range 1-7 days). These showed no significant differences in vitamin C status or protein carbonyl concentrations compared with baseline values (P = 0.6). Overall, the depleted vitamin C status and elevated oxidative stress observed in the patients with pneumonia indicates an enhanced requirement for the vitamin during their illness.

 &gt; […]

&gt; Although the samples in our study were collected prior to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, it is likely that people with COVID-19-associated pneumonia and sepsis would have similarly low vitamin C status and high oxidative stress. Early case reports from the 1940s indicated that IV administration of gram doses of vitamin C to cases of viral pneumonia rapidly improved common symptoms [35]. There are currently a number of intervention trials up and running around the world which will specifically test IV vitamin C for COVID-19-related pneumonia and sepsis. Furthermore, it is likely that patients with other severe infectious conditions may also have low vitamin C status. This has been previously demonstrated in patients with tuberculosis, bacterial meningitis, tetanus and typhoid fever [11, 12]. These patients would also likely benefit from additional vitamin C supplementation.

I think my readings on ACE2 distribution may be outdated by now, but earlier studies suggest that ACE2 receptors are very prevalent in the lungs and not so prevalent in the mouth, so the virus is unlikely to enter the body by any means other than direct inhalation. If that finding holds true, it would suggest that mouth-to-mouth kissing is significantly *safer* than breathing in each other's droplets (ACE2 receptors are very prevalent in the small intestine as well, but the virus is unlikely to survive stomach acid in large amounts).",3,t2_g1t74,2020-10-08 02:22:26,/r/COVID19/comments/j5juhf/weekly_question_thread_week_of_october_05/g80zm5y/,0

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j6unvo,t3_j6unvo,g81023o,"Reposting a comment I made on the UK version of this push a few weeks ago; I think it broadly applies here.

--------

&gt;In terms of policy, I agree with a lot in this response - at least I think that there should be a much, much lighter and more targeted touch this winter. Unfortunately, we still can't rigorously disentangle the effects of discrete interventions, but I think that ""lockdown"" is the wrong way to think about things moving forward: if any of the passive interventions (contact tracing) and npi compliance are doing their jobs, there's much much more leeway than in the spring. NZ/Korea/Vietnam-style elimination is way better than pure mitigation, but mitigation countries need to acknowledge their actual situation and use a range of less blunt tools to keep r&lt;=1. I'd also note that one problem with shielding is that it's inevitably going to fail to some degree, and compared to blanket suppression or blanket mitigation the peak of hospitalizations will probably be higher. So the harm of hospital avoidance and cancellation of elective surgeries comes into play here - the UK and other countries have resumed surgeries after the first decline, and this is one area where things are probably more fragile/brittle than they were in March. The economy, of course, is also probably more brittle - while sharp and short contractions are relatively tolerable, each successive economic blow is going to cause more scarring. 

&gt;I would, however, oppose ""herd immunity"" as a *strategy* per se: herd immunity is going to change based on population compliance, waning individual immunity, etc. Immunity is going to be unevenly distributed, too: even in a location with ""herd immunity"", stakeholders will need to be prepared to respond to hospitalization surges from explosive outbreaks in eg towns that were missed in the first wave. We also don't yet have a correlate of immunity - presumably some Nab titer - and it's going to be very difficult to figure out when you can pronounce that a community has herd immunity without causing behavioral changes that result in an outbreak.

&gt;I'd also push back a bit on the idea that we can engineer the course of an epidemic. Sure, in a perfect world we'd infect all the young people, protect all the old people, then they'd homogeneously mix and you've got herd immunity. But if many countries struggle to implement the blanket policies like testing, tracing, distancing, etc, I don't think we can expect them to suddenly achieve competence on a much more difficult task: monitoring and altering the path of the pandemic to achieve policy goals. I just think that this is going to fail, just as all efforts to isolate the vulnerable have failed so far. 

&gt;The other problem is what happens after ""herd immunity"" is reached. Let's say you're on the other side of this plan and you've somehow succeeded at isolating the vulnerable. You've got a cohort of young people that have been partying, seeing friends, attending school, etc - basically taking very few precautions. And you've got an older cohort that has been hermetically sealed from the rest of the population for a few months. Can older folks finally see their grandchildren? It seems not. Because once you change the behavior of the large at-risk cohort, suddenly the HIT will rise and you might see another epidemic. Worse, members of the at-risk group for this disease often interact with mostly other at-risk persons on a day to day basis. The most extreme example of this is nursing homes, but the entire elderly population is interconnected to some extent - friends, coworkers, spouses, siblings, etc. And to whatever extent that is, the elderly population represents a subpopulation with zero immunity. If everyone in this group goes back to having many close contacts a day, and most of those close contacts are other members of the group, then ""herd immunity"" might even tolerate a widespread epidemic among the elderly. 

&gt;I guess the response to this will be either ""the at-risk will be isolated until there's a vaccine"" or ""the at-risk can choose to leave isolation but there will be risk"". Honestly, though, this looks less and less to me like ""protect the vulnerable"" and more like ""let the vulnerable bear both the health and economic costs of the pandemic"". Of course, this is what would happen if everyone considered their own risk alone and in the absence of intervention, but that's the whole reason intervention is called for here: spread of infectious disease is clearly an externality.

&gt;Lastly, I'd like to note the signatories of the original shielding letter (not this response). I cannot overstate the damage to public health that several of these signatories have done over the course of the pandemic. Sunetra Gupta, for example, did a media tour in March suggesting that it was possible that 50% of the UK population was already immune. She proposed a severe % of cases that is lower than the current population fatality of the UK. We *knew* this was false at the time, but in perhaps the most pivotal moment of the epidemic in the UK she told the public that half of them could already be immune. Risk communication like this has consequences. Prof. Heneghan has been spreading misinformation for weeks that the very upswing *for which he is suggesting a policy response* is somehow an artifact of test specificity, nevermind the literally hundreds of thousands of samples that come up &gt;99.9% negative in low prevalence areas. Both of these people were pushing the flu-like IFR narrative until that became untenable. Both always went to media and the public first, often without peer review, to promote wild theories that minimized the severity of the pandemic. 

&gt;I really, really wish all the people on the ""do less"" side of things hadn't ruined their credibility by loudly getting subject after subject wrong. I'm not kidding - there's a lot to be said for fewer/more targeted interventions! We need better dialogue on these issues, and I'm tired of all the fear over beaches and the idea that lockdowns are our primary intervention (they were really ""break glass in case of emergency"" ones following the initial testing failures). But I think the group of loudly wrong contrarians does nobody any good. I've engaged with a lot of covid contrarian work, and I just don't think most of it is truth-oriented. Whatever policy agreements I have, I think that the discussion so far has tied some variously false or unlikely scientific ideas to totally legitimate policy positions. So while I agree that these discussions are increasingly needed, I'm convinced that they'll be fruitless to the extent that they include people like Heneghan and Gupta.

-------

In sum, I think the rhetoric here relies on misconceptions about the state of herd immunity we'd be achieving. I also would rather have an open and honest debate about the costs of such a strategy: rhetoric like ""focused protection"" does not describe a plan that proposes few measures to protect the vulnerable that are not already being implemented. It may still be worth it! But let's be honest about what it would cost - the debate will go nowhere otherwise. 

I also - as I noted above - think that the ""experts"" here have an extraordinarily shoddy track record on the basic science of COVID. While this is more policy-focused, I think it's worth keeping in mind the confident pronouncements made about herd immunity in March. I also am really tired of this group failing to engage in the academic discussion of these and related issues and instead going directly to policymakers and the press. At this point it just feels dishonest, and people working in this area have been forced to charitably reconstruct plausible shielding models in order to investigate them since their proponents are more interested in selling politicians on their ideas than publishing and refining them. And while I agree with several policies this group proposes, I do think that the political provenance of the ""Great Barrington Declaration"" is probably worth keeping in mind.

Finally, I think proponents of shielding/herd immunity do not consider the moral hazard involved in having infection in a certain population treated as a positive good by policy. Presumably, this would involve reducing employer liabilities to incentivize return to work and subsidizing riskier activities. But it seems to me that any leakage to the vulnerable would result in the government's having essentially subsidized a huge negative externality. And I think once we get away from the abstract, this becomes pretty heartbreaking - Grandparents who die because the government decides to stop providing relief for unemployed/underemployed ppl, etc.",3,t2_lp01t,2020-10-08 02:25:58,/r/COVID19/comments/j6unvo/covid19_group_of_uk_and_us_experts_argues_for/g81023o/,0

The discussion section does contain some simpler explanations. From there I'm gathering that what they have found is the cellular and molecular pathway that results in severe and critical disease. The exact triggers for that are not clear yet, but these findings can be used to identify what drugs to use for those patients. It also very well explains why steroids help at that stage - the immune system has responded with a very strong but inflammatory response. The viral infection is not the problem anymore, it's the inflammatory state.

Since the researchers seem to be very familiar with SLE (lupus), they're seeing some similarities with it and the severe/critical form of Covid-19. They think it might be an explanation for the long haul symptoms some recovered patients are experiencing (auto-reactive antibodies, they did not screen for any though).

While this paper is excellent at decribing the immediate triggers for the inflammation, the upstream triggers for the off-mark immune response are still missing.

We investigated this in more depth post hoc by adding covariates individually to the age, sex and smoking model, and found that the change in hazard ratio was driven largely by adjustment for chronic respiratory disease (HR 0.98 (0.90–1.06) after adjustment). This and other comorbidities could be consequences of smoking, highlighting that the fully adjusted smoking hazard ratio cannot be interpreted causally owing to the inclusion of factors that are likely to mediate smoking effects. We therefore then fitted a model adjusted for demographic factors only (age, sex, deprivation and ethnicity), which showed a non-significant positive hazard ratio for current smoking (HR 1.07 (0.98–1.18)).

There is also a book on it written by Richard Preston:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Demon_in_the_Freezer

The only bad thing I have to say about it is that Richard can sometimes be prone to embellishment for the sake of a good story. His description of Ebola in his book *The Hot Zone*, while for the most part *technically* accurate reads more like a horror novel than a realistic progression of the disease. Still a good book, but bear that in mind. The man likes to craft a good story. 

If you're looking for a truly excellent nonfiction on the subject of epidemiology and emerging diseases, then I highly recommend *Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic* by David Quammen. One chapter within charts the origin of AIDS to an isolated patch of rainforest in the 1800's. It's a great read and remarkably free of bullshit. It was published back in 2012 and seems prophetic now regarding COVID, although COVID or something like it was no great surprise.

If you're looking for a more speculative account of what the very worst is, then *Germs: Biological Weapons and America's Secret War* by Judith Miller is a very harrowing read that chronicles America and The USSR bioweapons programs at the height of the Cold War. A large portion of it is hearsay and conjecture regarding classified state secrets, but I don't doubt that much of it happened.",3,t2_2wqkpcs,2020-10-08 08:48:12,/r/COVID19/comments/j6jd6z/previous_infection_with_other_types_of/g828ep3/,0

Background: Coagulopathy and thromboembolic events are common in Covid‐19 patients and are poor prognostic factors. Controversy exists regarding the potential of anticoagulation (AC) to reduce mortality and incidence of thromboembolic events in Covid‐19 patients. The current systematic review and meta‐analysis investigated the association between anticoagulants and mortality in adult hospitalized COVID‐19 patients using the available published non‐randomized studies. Methods: Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, the Cochrane Library and Clinical Trials.gov were searched for relevant studies. A meta‐analysis of adjusted and unadjusted estimates was performed. The relative risk was used as a measure of effect. The random‐effects model was used to pool estimates using the generic inverse variance method. Results: Sixteen studies were included in the quantitative data synthesis. Results showed a statistically significant association between AC and mortality (RR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.36; 0.92, p = 0.02). Both therapeutic (Relative risk [RR] = 0.4, 95% CI 0.27; 0.57) and prophylactic AC (RR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.41; 0.71) were associated with lower risk of mortality. Pre‐admission AC was not associated with mortality (RR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.49; 1.43, p &gt; 0.05) while prophylactic AC was associated with higher risk of mortality compared to therapeutic AC (RR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.34; 1.87, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Findings support the association of AC with mortality in Covid‐19 patients. The results, synthesized from mostly low‐quality studies, show that prophylactic and therapeutic AC might reduce mortality in Covid‐19 patients. Findings suggest that therapeutic doses might be associated with better survival compared to prophylactic doses.",1,t2_4tmsh269,2020-10-08 10:31:42,/r/COVID19/comments/j74v1u/anticoagulation_outcomes_in_hospitalized_covid19/g82kj8s/,0

Objective

COVID 19 is a global health problem that can result in serious complications. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and clinical importance of vitamin D deficiency in children with COVID‐19.

Material and Methods

This study includes 40 patients who were diagnosed to have COVID‐ 19 and hospitalized with the real‐time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) method, 45 healthy matched control subjects with normal vitamin D levels. The age of admission, clinical and laboratory data, and 25‐hydroxycholecalciferol (25‐OHD) levels were recorded. Those with vitamin D levels which are below 20 ng/ml were determined as Group 1 and those with ≥20 ng/ml as Group 2.

Results

Patients with COVID‐ 19 had significantly lower vitamin D levels 13.14 μg/L (4.19‐69.28) than did the controls 34.81(3.8‐77.42) μg/L (p &lt; 0.001). Patients with COVID‐ 19 also had significantly lower serum phosphorus (4.09±0.73 vs. 5.06±0.93vs (U/L) (p&lt;0.001) values compared with the controls. The symptom of fever was significantly higher in COVID‐ 19 patients who had deficient and insufficient vitamin D levels than in patients who had sufficient vitamin D levels (p=0.038). There was a negative correlation found between fever symptom and vitamin D level (r=‐0.358, p = 0.023).

Conclusion

This is the first to evaluate vitamin D levels and its relationship with clinical findings in pediatric patients with COVID‐19. Our results suggest that vitamin D values may be associated with the occurrence and management of the COVID‐19 disease by modulating the immunological mechanism to the virus in the pediatric population.",1,t2_4tmsh269,2020-10-08 10:42:05,/r/COVID19/comments/j75163/is_vitamin_d_deficiency_a_risk_factor_for_covid/g82loee/,0

Background: The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) given their interaction with the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor remains controversial. .

Objective: To investigate the impact of ACEI/ARB on COVID-19 disease severity and mortality through a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods: We searched PubMed and CINAHL databases as well as pre-print servers for studies investigating usage of ACEIs/ARBs in patients with COVID-19 compared to a control group of COVID-19 patients without ACEI/ARB use. COVID-19 related severity of disease, and death were identified as end points. Pooled odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using random-effects model.

Results: 21 studies were included in the meta-analysis. For mortality with ACEI/ARB use, the pooled odds ratio was 1.29 [0.89-1.87] p = 0.18 with heterogeneity of 91%, while the pooled OR for COVID-19 severity was 0.94 [0.59-1.50] p = 0.81 with heterogeneity of 89% (Figure 2). In combining both mortality and severe disease outcomes, the pooled odds ratio was 1.09 [0.80-1.48] p = 0.58 but with heterogeneity of 92%.

Expert opinion: Even on pooled analysis of both un-adjusted data, adjusted data(studies with matched controls) and taking into account factors such as risk of bias of studies via meta regression and sensitivity analyses, the results hold true that ACEI/ARB use is not associated with COVID-19 disease severity or mortality. To look for any potential beneficial effects, randomized controlled trials are needed.

Conclusion: use of ACEI/ARB was not associated with increased mortality or severe COVID-19.",1,t2_4tmsh269,2020-10-08 10:47:14,/r/COVID19/comments/j754bv/angiotensin_converting_enzyme_inhibitors_and/g82m7zy/,0

Among Italy, Spain, and Japan, the age distributions of COVID-19 mortality show only small variation even though the number of deaths per country shows large variation. To understand the determinant for this situation, we constructed a mathematical model describing the transmission dynamics and natural history of COVID-19 and analyzed the dataset of mortality in Italy, Spain, and Japan. We estimated the parameter which describes the age-dependency of susceptibility by fitting the model to reported data, including the effect of change in contact patterns during the epidemics of COVID-19, and the fraction of symptomatic infections. Our study revealed that if the mortality rate or the fraction of symptomatic infections among all COVID-19 cases does not depend on age, then unrealistically different age-dependencies of susceptibilities against COVID-19 infections between Italy, Japan, and Spain are required to explain the similar age distribution of mortality but different basic reproduction numbers (R0). Variation of susceptibility by age itself cannot explain the robust age distribution in mortality by COVID-19 infections in those three countries, however it does suggest that the age-dependencies of (i) the mortality rate and (ii) the fraction of symptomatic infections among all COVID-19 cases determine the age distribution of mortality by COVID-19.",2,t2_4tmsh269,2020-10-08 10:51:56,/r/COVID19/comments/j7574j/the_age_distribution_of_mortality_from_novel/g82mpz4/,0

&gt;

A bacterial infection is not the same as a viral infection, and it's important to make that distinction. Post-viral Bacterial infections can cause all sorts of complications, especially if the virus left the patient's immune system in a compromised state. However, most common viruses don't have anywhere close to the long term effects it appears Covid viral infections cause, and there are plenty of post-viral Bacterial infections with Covid too. We're talking about [10% of all those infected](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2771111) experiencing long term symptoms. I've heard Sars-Cov-2 compared to Mono and bacterial pnemonia in that way. (Source: Michael Osterholm's weekly podcast).

It seems like in every single thread about complications with Covid19, without fail, there's a top comment saying ""this is probably common with other viruses.""

So no medical expertise whatsoever, no epidemiological expertise whatsoever. Just keep that in mind.

Basically they used a mathematical model to simulate a nation. They simulated an intervention period lasting for three months (91 days), with some interventions extended for an additional 30 days. In reality, interventions were in place for rather longer. They simulated  case isolation, household quarantine, and social distancing of over 70s by assuming that is still possible in an unmitigated outbreak. They did not include younger people with risk factors in the social distancing group. For the second wave they assumed the group over 70s would completely cease to social distance. In fact the paper assumes a fully unmitigated second wave. I don't think this reflects reality.

What they concluded was that if you let the virus rampage through the population relatively unchecked, but you protect the older people, that you would achieve a form of herd immunity. They conclude the younger people wouldn't die as much, and the second wave would be much worse for the older people if you assume everybody starts to fully mingle in social traffic as though there was no pandemic.

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j79s3y,t3_j79s3y,g83cl12,"#Abstract

**Background**

Quantifying antibody reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens may help understand its effect on COVID-19 severity at the population level. This antibody reactivity may be particularly prevalent among childcare providers, including pediatric health care workers (HCW) who may be more exposed to circulating coronaviruses.

**Methods**

Cross-sectional study that included adults in the Vancouver area in British Columbia (BC), Canada, between May 17 and June 19, 2020. A novel 10-plex antibody assay (IgG) was used to measure antibody reactivity against the spike protein from circulating coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1), SARS-CoV, and four SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Seroreactivity from previous viral exposure was ascertained using this assay, and by measuring total SARS-CoV-2 IgG/M/A antibodies against a recombinant spike (S1) protein using a commercial CLIA assay.

**Findings**

Among 276 participants (71% HCW), three showed evidence of direct viral exposure, yielding an adjusted seroprevalence of 0.6% [95%CI 0.2 to 3.1%], with no difference between HCW and non-HCW, or between paediatric and adult HCW. Among the remaining 273 unexposed individuals, 7.3% [95%CI 4.5% to 11.1%], 48.7 [95%CI 42.7% to 54.8%] and 82.4% [95%CI 77.4% to 86.7%] showed antibody reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 RBD, N or Spike proteins, respectively. This reactivity was evenly distributed as a function of age, sex or between paediatric and adult HCW, and partly correlated with reactivity to circulating coronaviruses (Spearman; range: 0.147 to 0.513 for significant correlation after false-discovery rate adjustment at 5%).

**Interpretation**

A substantial proportion of individuals in this population showed antibody reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 antigens despite low serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 exposure.",1,t2_blqmw,2020-10-08 17:05:18,/r/COVID19/comments/j79s3y/antibody_reactivity_to_sarscov2_in_adults_from/g83cl12/,0

SARS-CoV-2 antigens allowed us to distinguish antibody profiles between exposed and unexposed
participants, but also to identify that a significant proportion of unexposed individuals display antibody
reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens. This result is consistent with the highly prevalent frequency T cell
reactivity detected in about 40% of non-SARS-CoV-2-exposed individuals in recent studies (14, 15), and
with another smaller study where 12 out of 95 pre-pandemic sera exhibited cross-reactive IgG antibody
reactivity with conserved epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 proteins (S2 and N), using a flow cytometry method
validated by ELISA (28). Previous seroprevalence studies have either used single-antigen assays, focused
on SARS-CoV-2, or, in the latter case, examined cross-reactivity in selected sera (28). However, the
current study is remarkable by the reporting of SARS-CoV-2 antibody reactivity at the population level.",1,t2_blqmw,2020-10-08 17:09:10,/r/COVID19/comments/j79s3y/antibody_reactivity_to_sarscov2_in_adults_from/g83crtz/,0

&amp;#x200B;

\## Objective

&amp;#x200B;

Covid‐19 can involve multiple organs including the nervous system. We sought to characterize the neurologic manifestations, their risk factors, and associated outcomes in hospitalized patients with Covid‐19.

&amp;#x200B;

\## Methods

&amp;#x200B;

We examined neurologic manifestations in 509 consecutive patients admitted with confirmed Covid‐19 within a hospital network in Chicago, Illinois. We compared the severity of Covid‐19 and outcomes in patients with and without neurologic manifestations. We also identified independent predictors of any neurologic manifestations, encephalopathy, and functional outcome using binary logistic regression.

&amp;#x200B;

\## Results

&amp;#x200B;

Neurologic manifestations were present at Covid‐19 onset in 215 (42.2%), at hospitalization in 319 (62.7%), and at any time during the disease course in 419 patients (82.3%). The most frequent neurologic manifestations were myalgias (44.8%), headaches (37.7%), encephalopathy (31.8%), dizziness (29.7%), dysgeusia (15.9%), and anosmia (11.4%). Strokes, movement disorders, motor and sensory deficits, ataxia, and seizures were uncommon (0.2 to 1.4% of patients each). Severe respiratory disease requiring mechanical ventilation occurred in 134 patients (26.3%). Independent risk factors for developing any neurologic manifestation were severe Covid‐19 (OR 4.02; 95% CI 2.04–8.89; P &lt; 0.001) and younger age (OR 0.982; 95% CI 0.968–0.996; P = 0.014). Of all patients, 362 (71.1%) had a favorable functional outcome at discharge (modified Rankin Scale 0–2). However, encephalopathy was independently associated with worse functional outcome (OR 0.22; 95% CI 0.11–0.42; P &lt; 0.001) and higher mortality within 30 days of hospitalization (35 \[21.7%\] vs. 11 \[3.2%\] patients; P &lt; 0.001).

&amp;#x200B;

\## Interpretation

&amp;#x200B;

Neurologic manifestations occur in most hospitalized Covid‐19 patients. Encephalopathy was associated with increased morbidity and mortality, independent of respiratory disease severity.",1,t2_833zowha,2020-10-08 17:11:08,/r/COVID19/comments/j5rlas/frequent_neurologic_manifestations_and/g83cv72/,0

I had a really bad bout of health anxiety a few years back, and it was a terrible year.

When learning about anxiety in general as part as my healing process, I discovered that many symptoms do really exist as a consequence of the near constant release of stress chemicals by the brain, like adrenaline (I had panic attacks daily). I had heart symptoms, lung symptoms, and neurological symptoms. All of which were a combination of being extremely attuned to my body and the actual effects of these stress chemicals. 

I know it's often welcomed negatively when you tell someone that their symptoms are anxiety, or some parts of it anyway. I had exactly the same attitude at first. But I only started to heal when I accepted that it could in fact be anxiety. 

Of course there might be in many cases some actual physiological aspect to this post covid syndrome, as seen with other viruses. But to deny entirely that anxiety wouldn't play a part in this, especially considering the stress of knowing you were infected with a new pathogen of which we still know very little, seems inappropriate.

SARS-CoV-2 may pose an occupational health risk to healthcare workers. Here, we report the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, self-reported symptoms and occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2 among healthcare workers at a large acute care hospital in Sweden. The seroprevalence of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was 19.1% among the 2149 healthcare workers recruited between April 14th and May 8th 2020, which was higher than the reported regional seroprevalence during the same time period. Symptoms associated with seroprevalence were anosmia (odds ratio (OR) 28.4, 95% CI 20.6–39.5) and ageusia (OR 19.2, 95% CI 14.3–26.1). Seroprevalence was also associated with patient contact (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.9–4.5) and covid-19 patient contact (OR 3.3, 95% CI 2.2–5.3). These findings imply an occupational risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers. Continued measures are warranted to assure healthcare workers safety and reduce transmission from healthcare workers to patients and to the community.",1,t2_blqmw,2020-10-08 17:49:39,/r/COVID19/comments/j7a8nw/sarscov2_exposure_symptoms_and_seroprevalence_in/g83ern0/,0

Several predictions made by experts ahead of the UK-wide lockdown in March are confirmed in a detailed re-analysis of the data. The authors explain the background to their research

When the covid-19 pandemic hit, the reaction of researchers around the world was “How can I help?” The consequence was thousands of well meaning, but unreviewed preprint papers, and hundreds of suggestions cluttering the inboxes of the government’s scientific advisors.  

There had to be a better way. The Royal Society sent an appeal to the computer modelling community to help epidemiologists. “Rapid Assistance to Modelling the Pandemic” or RAMP—an acronym which seemed snappy in March—was set up. Soon dozens of coders were seconded to the leading modelling groups, contributing to the signal, not the noise. We rethought how to do peer review in a crisis. Firstly triage—we crowdsourced reviews of the preprints, then a rapid filtering to an expert review panel, and onwards to the UK government advisory committees SPI-M and SAGE.  

With rapid turnaround required by policymakers, even the best groups are in danger of slip ups, so another RAMP task was replication of influential work. We looked at the code for the modelling done by Neil Ferguson from Imperial College London.  His group’s blandly-titled “Report 9” predicted half a million deaths from covid-19 if nothing was done, and is generally regarded as “The Science” behind the lockdown. Reading it carefully, we noticed something surprising—while all the proposed measures slowed the epidemic, school closures increased the total number of deaths. Our first thought was that it was a mistake, but after a little work on the code, we replicated the result. The basic explanation for this counter-intuitive result is that an intervention that substantially suppresses the first-wave of the epidemic leads to a stronger second wave once the interventions are lifted.",1,t2_5sx3smr2,2020-10-08 18:21:36,/r/COVID19/comments/j7817v/effect_of_school_closures_on_mortality_from/g83gf3v/,0

Together with the *Li et al* study mentioned in the letter, there are absolutely no other publications that have looked at rectal / faecal PCR outside of patients with severe disease.

Personally, I don't think evidence exists that faeco-oral transmission of Sars-CoV-2 is prominent at all (outside of settings with woeful sanitation e.g. slums).  I think that purely GI-cases of Covid more likely represent a dead-end transmission.  I think it's interesting though that these publications raise the hypothesis that purely GI-Covid could be a very ""safe"" way of becoming infected  i.e. Sars-CoV-2 might be readily immunogenised and ""pacified"" if the infection results from intestinal ACE2 receptor binding without pulmonary ACE2 receptor binding.

I'm gobsmacked as to why there's been so little interest in rectal or faecal PCR. Betacoronavirus exists in bats as a gastrointestinal ""non-disease"".

I would see separation of sick people into quarantine as more effective solution but again, I'm an armchair expert with no data and knowledge. Without quarantine the disease would just go through the population. Contact tracing and compliance with it sounds promising to me.

If I somehow misunderstood the article and they do assume social distancing efforts continue even during the second wave I would like to be shown where they report this.

From the following passages I conclude social distancing was terminated during the second wave:

&gt;(...) at the end of the first wave, again defined as the time at which general social distancing was lifted.

&gt; (...) leads to a second wave when interventions are lifted. In the model this happened in July 2020

When was the social distancing removed from that model? after 224 days. The article seems to agree lifting social distancing for the elderly is the cause for this peak:

&gt;The third peak triggered by relaxing social distancing of over 70s affects the older age groups, leading to a substantial increase in the total number of deaths 

If you assume the elderly no longer practice any social distancing after some time you can conclude that a scenario with place closure (PC) will lead to many more deaths mainly in that age-group compared to a situation without PC.

Objectives

The Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor baricitinib may block viral entry into pneumocytes and prevent cytokine storm in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. We aimed to assess whether baricitinib improved pulmonary function in patients treated with high-dose corticosteroids for moderate to severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.

Methods

This observational study enrolled patients with moderate to severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia [arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) &lt;200 mmHg] who received lopinavir/ritonavir and HCQ plus either corticosteroids (CS group, n = 50) or corticosteroids and baricitinib (BCT-CS group, n = 62). The primary end point was the change in oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry (SpO2)/FiO2 from hospitalization to discharge. Secondary end points included the proportion of patients requiring supplemental oxygen at discharge and 1 month later. Statistics were adjusted by the inverse propensity score weighting (IPSW).

Results

A greater improvement in SpO2/FiO2 from hospitalization to discharge was observed in the BCT-CS vs CS group (mean differences adjusted for IPSW, 49; 95% CI: 22, 77; P &lt; 0.001). A higher proportion of patients required supplemental oxygen both at discharge (62.0% vs 25.8%; reduction of the risk by 82%, OR adjusted for IPSW, 0.18; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.43; P &lt; 0.001) and 1 month later (28.0% vs 12.9%, reduction of the risk by 69%, OR adjusted for IPSW, 0.31; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.86; P = 0.024) in the CS vs BCT-CS group.

Conclusions

. In patients with moderate to severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia a combination of baricitinib with corticosteroids was associated with greater improvement in pulmonary function when compared with corticosteroids alone",1,t2_2ouo0ilp,2020-10-08 19:48:21,/r/COVID19/comments/j7blgs/baricitinib_improves_respiratory_function_in/g83lof2/,0

COVID-19 causes persistent endothelial inflammation, lung and cardiovascular complications.
SARS-CoV-2 utilises the catalytic site of full-length membrane-bound angiotensin converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell entry causing downregulation of tissue ACE2. We reported
downregulation of cardiac ACE2 is associated with increased plasma ACE2 activity. In this
prospective observational study in recovered COVID-19 patients, we hypothesised that SARSCoV-2 infection would be associated with shedding of ACE2 from cell membranes and
increased plasma ACE2 activity.

**Methods -** We measured plasma ACE2 catalytic activity using a validated, sensitive quenched
fluorescent substrate-based assay in a cohort of Australians aged ³18 years (n=66) who had
recovered from mild, moderate or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive result by PCR
testing) and age and gender matched uninfected controls (n=70). Serial samples were available
in 23 recovered SARS-CoV-2 patients.

**Results -** Plasma ACE2 activity at a median of 35 days post-infection [interquartile range 30- 38 days] was 97-fold higher in recovered SARS-CoV-2 patients compared to controls (5.8 [2-11.3] vs. 0.06 [0.02-2.2] pmol/min/ml, p&lt;0.0001). There was a significant difference in plasma ACE2 activity according to disease severity (p=0.033), with severe COVID-19 associated with higher ACE2 activity compared to mild disease (p=0.027). Men (n=39) who were SARS-CoV2 positive had higher median plasma ACE2 levels compared to women (n=27) (p&lt;0.0001). We next analysed whether an elevated plasma ACE2 activity level persisted following SARS-CoV2 infection in subjects with blood samples at 63 [56-65] and 114 [111-125] days post infection. Plasma ACE2 activity remained persistently elevated in almost all subjects, with no significant differences between timepoints in post-hoc comparisons (p&gt;0.05).

**Discussion -** This is the first description that plasma ACE2 activity is elevated after COVID19 infection, and the first with longitudinal data indicating plasma ACE2 activity remains elevated out to a median of 114 days post- infection. Larger studies are now needed to determine if persistent elevated plasma ACE2 activity identifies people at risk of prolonged illness following COVID-19.",1,t2_blqmw,2020-10-08 19:51:25,/r/COVID19/comments/j7bm9q/plasma_ace2_activity_is_persistently_elevated/g83lweo/,0

**Introduction**

In Latin America, Peru is the most impacted country due to COVID-19 pandemic. Given the authorized nationwide use of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, ivermectin and dexamethasone in COVID-19 patients, we aimed to evaluate their effectiveness alone or combined to prevent 30-day mortality among COVID-19 hospitalized patients without life-threatening illness.

**Methods**

Design. Retrospective cohort study using digital clinical records to emulate a target trial. Setting. Nationwide data of mid- and high-level complexity hospitals from the Peruvian Social Health Insurance (EsSalud) between April 1 and July 19, 2020. Participants. Patients aged 18 years with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR, and non-severe pneumonia at admission. Interventions. We compared five treatment groups to the standard of care treatment regimen (control group) within 48 hours of admission to hospital: hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine alone (HCQ), ivermectin alone (IVM), azithromycin alone (AZIT), HCQ + AZIT group, and IVM + AZIT group with doses recommended by the Peruvian Ministry of Health. Main outcomes measures. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality rate, the secondary outcomes were survival without ICU rate, and survival without oxygen prescription rate. Analyses were adjusted for confounding factors by inverse probability of treatment weighting. A doubly-adjustment method was done for sensitivity analysis.

**Results**

Among 5683 patients eligible for analysis, 200 received hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine within 48 hours of hospital admission, 203 received ivermectin, 1600 received azithromycin, 692 received hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine plus azithromycin, 358 received ivermectin plus azithromycin and 2630 received standard of care. AZIT + HCQ group was associated with 84% higher all-cause mortality hazard rate compared to standard care (wHR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.12-3.02). Consistently, AZIT + HCQ treatment was associated with survival without transfer to ICU (wHR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.01-2.19) and survival without oxygen prescription (wHR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.07-2.69). HCQ treatment was associated with 77% higher all-cause mortality or oxygen prescription hazard rate compared to standard treatment (wHR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.01-3.11). Surprisingly, we observed that IVM treatment was associated with less survival rate without transfer to ICU in the weighted analysis (wHR = 1.58, 95% CI:1.11-2.25) By last, we did not find evidence of effect on reduce all-cause mortality or increase survival rate without transfer to ICU or survival rate without oxygen prescription for AZIT group neither AZIT + IVM group in all analyses.

**Conclusion**

The results of our target trial emulation match with previous findings of randomized clinical trials and observational studies, which showed no beneficial effects of hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, azithromycin, or their combinations.",1,t2_blqmw,2020-10-08 19:55:44,/r/COVID19/comments/j7bork/realworld_effectiveness_of_hydroxychloroquine/g83m7ny/,0

**Background**

SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies may protect from reinfection and disease, providing the rationale for administration of plasma containing SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (nAb) as a treatment for COVID-19. The clinical factors and laboratory assays to streamline plasma donor selection, and the durability of nAb responses, are incompletely understood.

**Methods**

Adults with virologically-documented SARS-CoV-2 infection in a convalescent plasma donor screening program were tested for serum IgG to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 domain, nucleoprotein (NP), and for nAb.

**Results**

Amongst 250 consecutive persons studied a median of 67 days since symptom onset, 243/250 (97%) were seropositive on one or more assays. Sixty percent of donors had nAb titers ≥1:80. Correlates of higher nAb titer included older age (adjusted OR [AOR] 1.03/year of age, 95% CI 1.00-1.06), male sex (AOR 2.08, 95% CI 1.13-3.82), fever during acute illness (AOR 2.73, 95% CI 1.25-5.97), and disease severity represented by hospitalization (AOR 6.59, 95% CI 1.32-32.96). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses of anti-S1 and anti-NP antibody results yielded cutoffs that corresponded well with nAb titers, with the anti-S1 assay being slightly more predictive. NAb titers declined in 37 of 41 paired specimens collected a median of 98 days (range, 77-120) apart (P&lt;0.001). Seven individuals (2.8%) were persistently seronegative and lacked T cell responses. 

**Conclusions**

Nab titers correlated with COVID-19 severity, age, and sex. Standard commercially available SARS-CoV-2 IgG results can serve as useful surrogates for nAb testing. Functional nAb levels were found to decline and a small proportion of COVID-19 survivors lack adaptive immune responses.",1,t2_blqmw,2020-10-08 19:57:09,/r/COVID19/comments/j7bpap/clinical_laboratory_and_temporal_predictors_of/g83mbbm/,0

**Introduction**

The severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), created a pandemic in late 2019. Acute respiratory distress syndrome can occur in patients with COVID-19 due to viral replication and an uncontrolled immune reaction. Therefore, antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatments are of particular interest to clinicians. We compared the efficacy of methylprednisolone and dexamethasone in reducing inflammation and improving the partial pressure of arterial oxygen and fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2 or P/F) ratio in COVID-19 patients.

**Methods**

We selected 60 files for this retrospective quasi-experimental study using a convenient sampling technique and divided them into two groups of 30 patients each who had received either dexamethasone or methylprednisolone. The data were taken from the medical records of the treated patients. Group 1 patients were given dexamethasone 8 mg twice daily, and Group 2 patients were given methylprednisolone 40 mg twice daily for eight days during their stay in our high dependency unit and our Intensive Care Unit. The remaining treatment was the same for both groups using antibiotics and anticoagulation. We reviewed C-reactive protein (CRP), serum ferritin level, and P/F ratio before and after the administration of both drugs for eight days. We used a paired t-test to assess the effectiveness of both drugs on the P/F ratio of participants.

**Results**

The initial mean CRP level of Group 1 was 110.34 mg/L, which decreased to 19.45 mg/L after administration of dexamethasone; similarly, the CRP of Group 2 was 108.65 mg/L, which decreased to 43.82 mg/L after administering methylprednisolone for eight days. Both dexamethasone and methylprednisolone significantly improved the P/F ratio (p&lt;0.05), and dexamethasone was significantly more effective than methylprednisolone (p&lt;0.05).

**Conclusions**

Steroids have ability to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune response make them an effective tool in the treatment of COVID-19. Steroid therapy is effective in controlling inflammation markers, and, specifically, dexamethasone is effective in improving the P/F ratio in COVID-19 patients.

The post-COVID-19 syndrome, is characterized by prolonged malaise, headaches, 
generalized fatigue, painful joints, dyspnea, chest pain and cognitive dysfunction.
[201-203] Approximately 10% of patients experience prolonged illness after Covid-19. 
The p[ost-COVID-19 syndrome may persistent for months after the acute infection 
and almost half of patients report reduced quality of life. The neurological symptoms 
may be related micro- and/or macrovascular thrombotic disease which appears to 
be common in severe COVID-19 disease.[188] Brain MRIs’ 3 months post-infection 
demonstrated micro-structural changes in 55% of patients. [204] Similar to patients 
who have recovered from septic shock, [205] a prolonged (many months) immune 
disturbance with elevated pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines may contribute to the 
post-COVID-19 syndrome. Consequently, A CRP should be measured prior to discharge 
and a tapering course of corticosteroids should be considered in those with an elevated 
CRP. It should be noted that much like omega-3 fatty acids corticosteroids have been 
demonstrated to increase expression of pro-resolving lipids including Protectin D1 and 
Resolvin D4.[206] Other interventions that should be considered include:

i. Vascepa, Lovaza or DHA/EPA 4g day; important for resolution of inflammation by 
inducing resolvin production. [48,49]
ii. Atorvastatin 40mg daily (increase resolvin synthesis) [207]
iii. Continue melatonin for its antioxidant properties and stabilization of the circadian 
rhythms. 
iv. Multivitamin with adequate vitamin D.

PLEASE SHARE THIS POST OR TEXT 

Email sent to publiccorrespondence@cabinetoffice.gov.uk 

Good afternoon,

I would like to make a complaint against the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock for his mishandling of the Covid 19 episode, specifically his repeated dismissal of the benefits of Vitamin D. He has, for several months, fobbed off many medical experts who appealed to him for council. The list of medical experts who have been trying to get Matt Hancock to listen are included in this article:

[https://www.nutraingredients.com/.../COVID-19-Scientists...](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/6269684515963757774/5855896864162006391#)

Had he listened to them back in March, as he should have done as Health Secretary of the nation, he would have realised Vitamin D deficiency is a major factor in both infection and recovery. All the types of people who are most likely to be Vitamin D deficient are also most likely to catch and die from this virus: the elderly, people with darker skin, people in the North of England and people not living on the coast. 

Had he done his job correctly and honestly, many lives could have been saved with the simple instruction to get out into the sun every day. The old-fashioned hospital method of wheeling all the sick, the invalid and the elderly out into the midday sun on hospital beds, wheelchairs and cots to get the daily dose of the sunshine vitamin would have saved many lives. It would also have saved tens of thousands of broken hearts caused by the imprisonment of our elderly, in particular the isolation in bedrooms of care home residents, deprived of normal human contact now for seven months. This is a form of torture that is absolutely wicked and must stop! Depriving them of the very basics on life: human contact, freedom and sunshine! And for a virus that has now been proven to not be passed from touching things!

Matt Hancock claimed 'government-led research' had been carried out to study the potential benefits of the vitamin and that it 'did not appear to have any impact'. This contradicts not only scientific findings but also centuries if not millennia of general knowledge of the benefits of sunshine. 

The only reason why this willful negligence has come to light is because the health department recently revealed the fact no government research had been conducted. I would like to know why Matt Hancock not only said research had been conducted when it had not but also how he derived findings from an imaginary research study. What, in my opinion, makes this 'misspeaking' the crime of Misconduct in a Public Office is that it may well have had a profound and detrimental effect on the nation: raised death rate, depression, suicide, untreated health issues, separation anxiety...the list is endless. In short, this abject rejection of wise words has, in many people's opinion, caused deaths and suffering on a massive scale. Not only have his refusals to listen meant the nation was falsely imprisoned, they have also meant the nation was forced to forgo the very thing that could have protected us from the virus: daylight.  This is, of course, in conjunction with the immeasurable economic consequences of lockdown, the sum of which will take decades to add up. 

I have reported Matt Hancock to the Metropolitan Police (crime number CHS28206 3rd October). They have told me I have got to make my allegations directly with the UK government and gave me this email address. They have also told me to communicate my concerns with the speaker of the House of Commons, which I will do. 

My belief is that this alleged crime is so serious that it encompasses more than the crime of Misconduct in a Public Office but also manslaughter and false imprisonment. 

I trust that the police are correct and that you will investigate this matter.

Even if we had a good vaccine tomorrow, it doesn't make much difference until 80% of the population gets it.

One of those simple laws of nature everyone should be taught, from systems science : the total error of a system is the sum of the errors of each of its parts. Tracking and tracing are good. Trying to get a good vaccine and trying to get enough people to take it are the right things to do, but right now, the chances of success are not promising.

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j7h7lw,t3_j7h7lw,g84ky2x,"I wrote this article, and I thought that /r/COVID19 would find it interesting. In short, men and women did not significantly differ in their self-reported face mask wearing frequency, but they did have some significantly differing perceptions. Men were more likely to think that face masks infringe upon their independence, whereas women were more likely to find face masks to be uncomfortable. These differences in perceptions could influence relevant interventions and/or behavioral outcomes other than face mask wearing (e.g., word-of-mouth regarding face masks). Full abstract is below

&gt;Recent popular press authors have proposed that men are less likely to wear face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigate this notion in the current article by analyzing three extant datasets. We also assess the mediating effect of eight different face mask perceptions in the relation between gender and face mask wearing via the Face Mask Perceptions Scale. Across the three datasets, the sample-size weighted meta-analytic correlation between gender and face mask wearing was not statistically significant, and no face mask perception was a consistent mediator of this effect. Gender did have significant relations with two face mask perceptions, however. Men were more likely to perceive face masks as infringing on their independence, whereas women were more likely to perceive face masks as uncomfortable. Therefore, although gender does not relate to whether a person wears a face mask, it does relate to face mask perceptions. We offer several suggestions for research and practice from these results, such as the positioning of face mask wearing alongside passive health behaviors, the broader study of face mask perceptions' outcomes beyond face mask wearing, as well as the creation of interventions to target differing face mask perceptions across genders.",2,t2_36s8x,2020-10-09 01:19:55,/r/COVID19/comments/j7h7lw/gender_face_mask_perceptions_and_face_mask/g84ky2x/,0
COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j6obus,t3_j6obus,g84lkop,"False positives of the PCR test is a huge scandal.  

The Lancet paper at the link above includes, "" the pretest probability will have steadily decreased as the proportion of asymptomatic cases screened increased against a background of physical distancing, lockdown, cleaning, and masks, which have reduced viral transmission to the general population ""

Many months ago Dr. Birx of the US POTUS COVID task force explained similarly in [this short clip.](https://youtu.be/MdT6GPSIki8?t=3143)

An assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard Medical School, Michael Mina, explains in a [Harvard Magazine article](https://harvardmagazine.com/2020/08/covid-19-test-for-public-health) that the PCR test amplifies viral RNA to detectable levels.

However the test can also ”detect tiny fragments of viral RNA even after the patient has recovered.”

“the vast majority of PCR positive tests we currently collect in this country are actually finding people long after they have ceased to be infectious.”

Mina's paper  [https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2025631](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2025631)

[This article](https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-tests-may-be-picking-up-traces-of-dead-virus-12064151) presents similar information from a study at Oxford.

“they found the tests were able to detect traces of the virus’s genetic material for a much longer period than it remains infectious”

In this [2 minute clip](https://youtu.be/cy1kdZhXsP8?t=260) the Chief of Emergency Medicine at E. Virginia Med School hospital explains a graph of data comparing PCR test results with actual culture test results. The results are strikingly DIFFERENT! There are far more positive PCR tests, especially when the test was done more than 8 days after onset of symptoms.

[Later in the same video](https://youtu.be/cy1kdZhXsP8?t=439) a similar graph is presented but with the cycle threshold clearly visible. Notice that there are NO positive culture tests above the threshold of 30, yet many labs use a much higher threshold of 40. This causes many more tests to be classified as positive, possibly false-positive when trying to determine who still has live, replicating virus.

[In this clip](https://youtu.be/ZFNdsRHKUM4?t=740) Dr. Chris Martenson describes a study of one lab using the higher threshold of 40. If the lab used a threshold of 35, HALF of the people who were considered positive would have been negative.

[In this one minute](https://youtu.be/ZFNdsRHKUM4?t=470) clip Martenson presents study data suggesting that after 34 cycles it was not possible to cultivate live virus.

The PCR test should include the number of cycles required to trigger the positive result. 

[The CEO of a hospital in India](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/77956302.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=cppst) says they switched to a lab that includes the cycle threshold.

Fatigue is already a big thing and probably the majority of people will just say ‘screw it’ and ignore any NPIs when the harm has been reduced massively by vaccines, treatments etc. (for good reason)

However this approach is also incredibly self defeating. Say the govts take this on board and start promoting the ‘new normal’ for long term even after a vaccine is released. Would most people actually take if it did nothing restrictions wise? In the article they say 40% wouldn’t take it even with the promise of more normality, what sort of figures would it be if this letter’s approach was implemented? Having less people taking it then leads to any vaccine being less effective, basically killing it before it gets off the ground. Any future ones would suffer the same fate even if it gives complete sterilising immunity, the first one did nowt so why would this one do anything.

Fatigue would still be an issue as well, people start to disregard the current NPIs which would potentially lead to more Covid than the back to normal after vaccine scenario ironically. Add to that mental health deterioration and medical treatments being delayed/cancelled entirely leads to more avoidable loss of life.

Of course this has spillover effects. People start turning away from other vaccines as they’ve been tarred with the same brush, increasing the prevalence of more serious and deadly diseases particularly in the younger folk. Maybe people lose more faith in science in general. Trust in authority would suffer as well and conspiracy theories would become more widely accepted, people talking about the govt/NWO or whatever controlling your life would certainly have a lot to go on.

Hopefully I’m not misinterpreted as being against NPIs for the time being, Covid is serious and should be dealt with seriously. However anyone who thinks that they could/should continue for eternity doesn’t really have their head on straight.

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j7bork,t1_g83m7ny,g84q0wu,"So, yet another study in which HCQ was given to people sick enough to be admitted to the hospital. Why?

Way back, before widespread testing was available and COVID-19 cases almost entirely consisted of very sick people, it was anecdotally noticed that lupus and RA patients who take HCQ for their conditions seemed to be underrepresented among COVID-19 cases. That was where the idea that HCQ might have prophylactic benefit came from. It was not proposed as a cure for people already sick enough to be admitted to the hospital. It was not proposed that it prevents the minor/asymptomatic cases that we now know account for the vast majority of COVID-19 cases - because at the time, no one knew about these. (Remember when it was thought that COVID-19 presented as a serious illness by default in which a ""mild"" case was pneumonia? That was a relic of limited testing capacity.) It was simply noted - anecdotally - that these patients were underrepresented among the very sick people who presented, at the time, as COVID-19 cases. This reality has almost been memory-holed, but speaking as someone who was following this from the very beginning last January, I remember reading this and I have found sources that reference this idea.

Whether or not HCQ actually does have any benefit in this regard is not the point of what I am saying. The point is that people keep framing studies that do not look at the actual question: **Does prophylactic use of HCQ reduce serious COVID-19 cases?** Maybe not, and if the correct answer is ""no,"" then fine, but that means a study in subjects who have been using HCQ long before any possible exposure (meaning that studies like this one, in which its effect when given to already very sick people, and studies on ""post exposure prophylaxis"" are irrelevant), with a ""case"" counted not as a PCR positive but by criteria like ICU admission or death. My investment is not whether HCQ is helpful or not but because I continue to be annoyed by badly undertaken science -  here, in the constant, droning attempts to use what are basically straw man hypotheses.

EDIT: I get that this study also looked at other medications. I am questioning the point of wasting time studying the use of HCQ given to already very ill people.",2,t2_5lh679m9,2020-10-09 02:01:11,/r/COVID19/comments/j7bork/realworld_effectiveness_of_hydroxychloroquine/g84q0wu/,0

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_h8h0k2,t1_fuvepoy,g84tfga,"Actually, it is a right. Nobody has the right to inject me with any substance without my consent, period. End of discussion. Of course there can be circumstances where public health could *possibly* benefit from forced vaccinations to get that “last little bit” of people, but as stated above, you don’t even need everyone to get the vaccine to *drastically* reduce the numbers. Forcing people to get vaccinated in order to get that “last little group” of people immunized really doesn’t have much more effect when the majority (or at least a large percentage) of people already have it. 

But there is also a negative. And I believe that negative *vastly* outweighs the pros. Most people will probably get the vaccine on their own. But you have to look at the repercussion of forcing people to take vaccines. It sounds nice when the vaccine works and has little to no side effects. But what happens when a vaccine comes along and got fucked up somehow? The HPV vaccine is known to have some pretty fucked up side effects in certain people.

Imagine a situation where the COVID vaccine (or any similar situation in the future requiring a vaccine) was just too rushed and ends up with severe side effects. But the government/vaccine companies refuse to admit it since it would look *very* bad, so they just keep quiet. You can think it’s unlikely all you want, but I am not willing to put my life into the hands of a pharmaceutical company or a government agency. It’s a matter of principle.

That’s not the same thing. Even masks are a pretty big burden and are already being discarded more and more where they are inconvenient. This is with the pandemic in full swing, nobody is going to follow any of this without the immediate danger of a high daily death toll. Whether it’s with a vaccine or just the natural die-out of the pandemic, as the daily death toll falls the adherence to intrusive policies is going to go down drastically.

That’s not to say absolutely nothing will change. Things that people actually like will probably catch on. It probably won’t be seen as “heroic” to go into work sick anymore, keep your germs home till you feel better. Partial work-from-home is probably here to stay because people like it and companies can either reduce footprint or convert office space to more productive use.

And the “test every day” idea was dead on arrival for a good reason. For one thing, the faster and cheaper a test is (and a test used by everyone everyday would have to be instantaneous and literally cost pennies), the more inaccurate it is.

However I don’t trust doctors not to dismiss patients by saying it’s all anxiety. Few doctors have as much compassion as to explain that an anxiety/stress response is real and brain-physical. 

Also sometimes it is anxiety, sometimes it is physical. We don’t have a good way to distinguish, and for whatever reason when we can’t figure out which one it is, we tend to default to saying it’s “just anxiety” though we have no actual reason to deny it could be physical, just something we don’t know how to measure. Other times, it is a physical problem that can only be resolved once another medical issue is addressed, as happened with me. 

For years my symptoms were dismissed as anxiety, and I say dismissed because they weren’t kind about it, didn’t entertain other physical hypotheses, and didn’t listen to psychologists who disagreed with the doctors assessment of anxiety and my symptoms being always connected. My symptoms are indeed body-physical, turns out. Took 10 years to get lab diagnosed though due to this bias of doctors.

Speaking about contagious disease generally, rather than just COVID: 

Individual immune response, as always, is hugely variable. Also the exact nature of the exposure. Was it aerosolized? Waterborne? The example of the monkeys I offered appears to involve direct injections into the bloodstream of infective agent. Thats not usually typical of transmission events in the real world. Finding out exact exposure levels outside of a lab is far more difficult and messy.

Also, which infective agent are we talking about and what is it's virulence? Not all disease causing organisms are equal in this regard. Q fever for instance is notoriously infective, with the number of bacteria required to infect half of those exposed being a *single bacterium.* Even different COVID mutations, different substrains, have difference degrees of pathogeny.

I'm not aware what dosage of COVID is considered to be infective in the average person, nor do I think that the scientific community has currently nailed that down with absolute certainty, though I could be mistaken. It would take much more to extrapolate the level of viral exposure necessary to see a measurable increase in morbidity. It could be exponential, but I doubt it's that clean of a line.

Is a medical intervention that prolongs life by 6 months at the cost of excruciating pain for that remaining time worth it? We don't allow doctors to make that decision for patients. 

Obviously greater latitude must be given in the area of public health because more than one person is involved. I have no problems, for example, with mandatory vaccination laws or social distancing laws during a pandemic. There has to be limits, though. Everything has a trade-off. Everything has a cost. Were there deaths that occurred as a result of the lockdowns and social-distancing that wouldn't have occurred otherwise? Certainly yes, but those deaths were hopefully less than what would have occurred without the lockdowns. At some point that calculus shifts, and it would be helpful to be able to have an honest discussion about when the costs of social distancing outweigh the benefits.

I do not qualify as an expert. Perhaps someone who does qualify as an expert, and also has similar views to these three experts, can address some critical issues not covered in what I have seen so far about this new push.

(1) What about the impact such a change in strategy might have on our healthcare providers whom we depend on to help us fight the pandemic? We have already witnessed the tragic deaths of so many who heroically fought on the front lines. I have probably misjudged these experts, but they seem to me like the stereotypical ivory tower professors who rarely, if ever, set foot in a COVID-19 ICU.

(2) These experts' views about how to manage the impact on the people who qualify as high-risk seems too simplistic to me. Their views seem to depend on unrealistic abstract ideas about how our cultures can carefully manage the necessary precautions to protect those who face a higher risk. However, the complexities of actually working out those details seems like a downstream effort, TBD. Yes, they do wave their hands with some generalized explanations, but changing horses in midstream has unanticipated hazards.

I think that I understand their main point, namely that we need to look at the wider array of impacts on public health associated with lockdowns. However, another alternative also exists. The whole world could unite in an intense coordinated and serious uniform lockdown for two weeks, with police on the streets to arrest the offenders. We could set the timing for that lockdown at a point after we have put in place global teams of contact tracers who will follow up after the lockdown. Then, we might have a chance of getting the pandemic under control at a global level. If we could get it under control, that would seem to resolve the issues about the wide array of public health issues better than not using lockdowns. Instead, we seem stuck in a dangerous longterm cycle of relatively ineffective types of lockdowns.",1,t2_6q5c9,2020-10-09 04:57:25,/r/COVID19/comments/j6unvo/covid19_group_of_uk_and_us_experts_argues_for/g85epth/,0

To discuss the points you raise, I will repeat that the anecdotal observation, which occurred very early during the pandemic, was that RA/lupus patients were underrepresented among COVID-19 cases. (At the time, this meant seriously ill people - not just minor/asymptomatic cases, the extent of which no one knew yet.) The idea surfaced that perhaps taking HCQ (and similar) on a long-term, maintenance basis, had some protective/prophylactic benefit.

1. How common RA/lupus patients are is irrelevant (unless they were so rare as to reach the point of statistical insignificance). If they are x% percent of a population, no matter how small x is, if they are significantly less than x% of COVID-19 cases, that was thought to be something worth following up on. Is it true that they are underrepresented and if so, what factor(s) contributes to that? Maintenance use of HCQ was pinpointed as a possible factor to follow up on.

2. It doesn't matter when the study was started. The original observation was based on patients using HCQ as a maintenance medication. If a study were started the next day, a properly conceived hypothesis would have been based on some form of long-term, maintenance use of the medication and seeing if that correlates to fewer serious cases.",2,t2_5lh679m9,2020-10-09 05:11:11,/r/COVID19/comments/j7bork/realworld_effectiveness_of_hydroxychloroquine/g85gnqn/,0
COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j7irwc,t3_j7irwc,g85gvho,"This article misrepresents the evidence. 


&gt; That raised the now contentious question: should members of the public bother wearing basic surgical masks or cloth masks? If so, under what conditions? “Those are the things we normally [sort out] in clinical trials,” says Kate Grabowski, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland. “**But we just didn’t have time for that**.”

This implies that we *don’t* have clinical trials on the effectiveness of masks - we do, we have many of them.

&gt; So, scientists have relied on observational and laboratory studies. 

And that’d be somewhat compelling if not for the RCTs that reach opposite conclusions. 

Observational studies can never support *causation*, only correlation. The very strongest conclusion you can legitimately reach from an observational study is that “these two things seem to correlate.” An observational study cannot provide evidence that masks work. 

Beyond this, such studies are subject to strong biases, including cherry picking: we can find places where masks were introduced and cases dropped, and places where masks were introduced and cases increased. If I do a study using cities in the former group, and you do a study using cities from the latter group, we will reach opposite conclusions and neither of our studies actually proves anything. 

Lab simulations suffer from the obvious limitation that they are unrealistic. For example, one study had people wear a mask properly and breath into a cone for 30 minutes while never touching their mask or face. 

Go anywhere you like with people - grocery store, parking lot, playground - and watch people. Within a few seconds, you’ll see people touch their masks, pull them down onto their chin, remove them to eat a sandwich, etc. Occasionally (and hilariously) you’ll see someone pull down their mask just prior to sneezing (gross but entirely understandable for everyone who doesn’t have a supply of extra masks on them at all times: no one wants to spend the day with their cloth mask full of snot). A lab simulation tells us only that masks can physically block some things from passing through under those lab conditions; they do NOT tell us whether the mask will have the same effect under realistic conditions.",8,t2_7yasek1e,2020-10-09 05:12:43,/r/COVID19/comments/j7irwc/face_masks_what_the_data_say/g85gvho/,0

In the animal models, the Moderna, Novavax, Pfizer, and J&amp;J vaccines all pretty much eliminated virus from the upper airways after a day or two. Also, all of the animal models involved gigantic injected doses.

 We don't know how people would do with a regular exposure. Possible we'd get even a complete sterilizing effect or even faster elimination.

Seventy percent of the population having something that reduces transmission by 70 percent (50 percent overall reduction in transmission) would let us return to most of our lives while suppressing the virus.",4,t2_gxy15,2020-10-09 05:16:08,/r/COVID19/comments/j7g6tr/covid19_we_will_not_be_returning_to_the_old_normal/g85hcmt/,0

Could it be because of antibody levels going down with time and thus the current seroprevalence vastly underestimating how many people were in contact with sars-cov-2?

The results show that looking at different assays, which are reactive to RBD, N, or S proteins on the virus, show radically different levels of prevalence in this sample, especially over time. This has been repeated in other studies for instance one that showed [much more consistent persistence of prevalence of S antibodies in Ontario](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.28.20200915v2).

This study isn't meant to show antibody prevalence in the Vancouver public so much as it is to show performance of this particular assay when put up against presumed-positive samples and targeting the different proteins.

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j7irwc,t3_j7irwc,g85me6t,"For a science article, saying 

&gt;Many believe that asymptomatic transmission is driving much of the COVID-19 pandemic, which would suggest that viruses aren’t typically riding out on coughs or sneezes. By this reasoning, aerosols could prove to be the most important transmission vehicle. So, it is worth looking at which masks can stop aerosols.

is a pretty unsupported claim. How many is ""many""? And who does it refer to, scientists, epidemiologists, doctors? What's their proof of ""many"" holding the belief?  

Even assuming that asymptomatic transmission accounted for most transmission (which remains pretty speculative), does it actually follow that ""viruses aren't typically riding out on coughs and sneezes""? I don't think so, between allergies and environmental irritants like cigarettes and pollution, which make asymptomatic people sneeze and cough, and the fact that speaking and breathing also produce aerosols that remain suspended for potentially long periods, droplet transmission doesn't just *disappear.* Even if asymptomatic transmission accounted for *all* transmission, it may still be ""riding out on coughs and sneezes"" (or fomites, or speech-generated droplets...) 

And in so many of the aerosol pre-prints circulating (pardon the pun?) the authors use the word ""important"" when referring to the possibility of airborne or aerosol transmission without defining it or putting it in context. Maybe it's the pedant in me, but isn't ""important"" more of a subjective measure than adjectives like ""significant"" or ""primary"" or ""major""?

&gt;“You can’t do randomized trials for everything — and you shouldn’t.” As clinical researchers are sometimes fond of saying, parachutes have never been tested in a randomized controlled trial, either.

Every time I see the parachute analogy being used, I'm reminded of this paper 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5878948/

&gt;Results: Of 822 articles citing the original paper, 35 (4.1%) argued that a medical practice was akin to a parachute. Eighteen of the 35 (51%) concerned mortality or live birth, and 17 (49%) concerned a lesser outcome. For 22 practices (63%), we identified 1 or more RCTs: in 6 cases (27%), the trials showed a statistically significant benefit of the practice; in 5 (23%), the trials rejected the practice; in 5 (23%), the trials had mixed results; in 2 (9%), the trials were halted; and in 4 (18%), the trials were ongoing. Effect size was calculated for 5 of the 6 practices for which RCTs gave positive results, and the absolute risk reduction ranged from 11% to 30.8%, corresponding to a number needed to treat of 3-9.

&gt;Interpretation: Although there is widespread interest regarding the BMJ paper arguing that randomized trials are not necessary for practices of clear benefit, there are few analogies in medicine.

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j7lt97,t1_g85vcbl,g85zanm,"Regarding methemoglobinemia in covid:
&gt; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) has been associated with a range of hematologic findings and complications [1]. We have encountered three cases of significant methemoglobinemia, and five cases of relatively mild methemoglobinemia, among patients being treated for COVID‐19 in our health system during a 4 week period in April 2020. For comparison, there was only one case of mild acquired methemoglobinemia of any cause documented in our health system during the preceding year. Below we describe the three cases of significant methemoglobinemia, including their presentations, treatments, and outcomes

&gt; [...]

&gt; The diagnosis of methemoglobinemia is seldom thought of given its rarity, and thus may remain underdiagnosed during the COVID‐19 pandemic. The typical presentation consists of abrupt symptoms of tissue hypoxia following exposure to an oxidizing substance. Notably, as this is a condition of increased heme‐oxygen avidity rather than hypoxemia, dissolved oxygen levels on blood gas may be normal in spite of clinical evidence of hypoxia and decreased readings on pulse oximetry. A high index of suspicion is thus required and diagnosis is most often made on co‐oximetry or specific blood Met‐Hb assay.

As discussed earlier its known that vitamin C is very low in covid patients and these are all symptoms of scurvy:
&gt; In a forensic context, scurvy may mimic inflicted injuries and may be responsible for sudden death by mechanisms that remain unclear. Cardiac failure and rhythm disturbances with chest pain, hypotension, cardiac tamponade, and dyspnea are associated with vitamin C deficiency. In addition, syncope and seizures may occur.

&gt; [...]

&gt; The first manifestation of scurvy is lassitude with other psychological manifestations including depression, hypochondriasis, psychomotor retardation, “personality change,” and confusion, possibly associated with disturbances in the function of the basal motor nuclei.2,34 Estimates have varied among reports, with clinical symptoms and signs taking between 30 and 120 days to appear after vitamin C was ceased in the diet, with overt scurvy developing between 40 and 180 days.1,4 Weight loss occurs with bleeding manifestations.35https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30422823/

Many studies have been conducted that demonstrate HCQ doesn't help, and the post-exposure prophylaxis study adds to the notion that it does not stop viral replication effectively in vivo (which was the primary early arguments for its utility). 

From a mechanistic perspective, the only alternative is immunomodulation, which would essentially reflect its application in SLE and RA, requiring weeks of therapy before efficacy is achieved. This effect is better achieved by corticosteroid administration on a targeted and short term basis, which has panned out most notably in the Recovery trial. 

At this point, HCQ as a therapy or prophylactic agent for COVID lacks equipoise, that is it has the potential to contribute to fatal cardiac dysrrhythmias and has repeatedly been shown not to improve any meaningful outcome. The idea that large swaths of the population (because the sample size required for a true prophylaxis study are very large) should be given a not-totally-benign agent for very long periods of time in order to  definitively put the nail in its coffin is an unethical proposal in my opinion.",1,t2_3stjcw9,2020-10-09 09:34:38,/r/COVID19/comments/j7bork/realworld_effectiveness_of_hydroxychloroquine/g86a1m9/,0

Severe corona virus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is characterized by inflammation of the lungs with increasing respiratory impairment. In fatal Covid-19, lungs at autopsy have been filled with a clear liquid jelly. However, the nature of this finding has not yet been determined.The aim of the study was to demonstrate if the lungs of fatal Covid-19 contain hyaluronan as it is associated with inflammation and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and may have the appearance of liquid jelly.Lung tissue obtained at autopsy from three deceased Covid-19 patients was processed for hyaluronan histochemistry using a direct staining method and compared with staining in normal lung tissue.Stainings confirmed that hyaluronan is obstructing alveoli with presence in exudate and plugs, as well as in thickened perialveolar interstitium. In contrast, normal lungs only showed hyaluronan in intact alveolar walls and perivascular tissue. This is the first study to confirm prominent hyaluronan exudates in the alveolar spaces of Covid-19 lungs, supporting the notion that the macromolecule is involved in ARDS caused by SARS-CoV-2. The present finding may open up for new treatment options in severe Covid-19, aiming at reducing the presence and production of hyaluronan in the lungs.",1,t2_4tmsh269,2020-10-09 10:06:35,/r/COVID19/comments/j7qkoc/presence_of_hyaluronan_in_lung_alveoli_in_severe/g86dim2/,0

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j7re9q,t3_j7re9q,g86jn3f,"GLASGOW, Scotland--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ILC Therapeutics, a Scottish biotech company, has announced that its unique synthetic Interferon called Alfacyte™ is fifteen to twenty times more effective at preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus which causes COVID-19) in cell culture than other commercially-available Interferons such as Interferon alpha 2 and Interferon beta 1a. COVID-19 tries to slow down the body’s innate Interferon response to viral infection and Alfacyte™ is designed to help accelerate this response and prevent disease progression.

Independent research at the University of St Andrews led by Dr Catherine Adamson, a specialist in viral diseases, demonstrated the superior effectiveness of Alfacyte™ in vitro against SARS-CoV-2.

Alfacyte™ is a synthetic molecule based on the human Alpha Interferons and was invented by Professor William Stimson, Founder and Chief Scientific Officer at ILC Therapeutics.

Dr Alan Walker, CEO of ILC Therapeutics, welcomed the results as a significant development in the fight against COVID-19: “This is a very positive development as the world prepares to face a second wave. Therapeutic interventions are crucial for us to tame COVID-19. The Innate Immune System represents an immunological “wall” against viral infection. If we can hold the virus at this “wall” long enough for the Adaptive Immune Response to get ready for battle, then COVID will not be able to progress into ARDS and cause systemic damage.”

The Alpha Interferons are a family of 12 natural proteins which everyone produces. Thus far only one subtype is used therapeutically, the Interferon Alpha 2. Professor William H. Stimson has spent two decades studying all the subtypes and their effectiveness as immunoregulators and antivirals, not just for COVID-19 but for other coronavirus-based illnesses such as SARS or MERS. His work has led him to construct a new patented synthetic Alpha Interferon, called Alfacyte™, based on the most effective and powerful Alpha Interferon subtypes.

Professor Stimson, stated: “COVID-19 and other coronaviruses have spent a lot of evolutionary energy trying to protect themselves against the Interferon alpha because overcoming the Innate Immune System is their main concern. They attack by delaying the production of Interferon alpha and so break through the Innate Immune defensive wall before the Adaptive Immune System is prepared to fight them. Timing is everything and by delivering a powerful Interferon like Alfacyte™ to the airways using a nebuliser we hope to accelerate and support the Innate Immune defences and prevent viral infection spreading and worsening. As well as having direct anti-viral activity Alfacyte™ is a powerful stimulator of Natural Killer (NK) cells that play a critical role if defending against the spread of COVID-19. These properties make Alfacyte™ an extremely promising drug candidate for COVID-19 therapy.”

The University of St Andrews’ Dr Catherine Adamson, who oversaw the tests, said: “This is a hugely exciting development and it demonstrates that there is a significant difference in the bioactivity of Interferon sub types against Coronaviruses. These differences may have important therapeutic implications for COVID-19.”

ILC Therapeutics is in the process of conducting further testing of Alfacyte™ and hopes to proceed to clinical trials by next year.",1,t2_4tmsh269,2020-10-09 11:06:22,/r/COVID19/comments/j7re9q/ilc_therapeutics_announces_significant_covid19/g86jn3f/,0

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j7oyip,t1_g86kfdz,g86to0a,"This is pretty difficult to answer because it all depends on where the mutation is.

Firstly I’ll say that mutations don’t seem to be as big of a concern with coronavirus compared to viruses like the flu which mutate more frequently. The significance of mutations may also depend on where the primers target in the virus genome. If the primers target sequences associated with the spike protein, mutations will probably not be significant as this region tends to not change too much.

PCR uses short sequences of nucleotides (the building blocks of DNA &amp; RNA) called primers to identify the viruses genetic material. There are many different primers which can be used to detect coronavirus. Primers work by binding to ‘matching’ nucleotides in the viruses genome. Therefore, a mutation in these target regions could theoretically make the primers unable to bind. However, this is a concern for all primers and doesn’t specifically apply to those used in this test.

Hope that explanation helped somewhat but unfortunately a definitive answer is hard to give.",2,t2_jdifk,2020-10-09 13:04:27,/r/COVID19/comments/j7oyip/new_test_detects_coronavirus_in_just_5_minutes/g86to0a/,0

&gt;...wearing simple masks was highly effective (0.32, 0.25 to 0.40; five studies)...

&gt;Conclusions

&gt;.... In situations of high risk of transmission, barrier measures should be implemented such as wearing gloves, gowns, and masks with a filtration apparatus, and isolation of likely cases.

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j7sg4h,t3_j7sg4h,g86vnke,"I posted this in another thread with some edits:

These articles are stuck in April.

What the author doesn't mention is that a number of Vetenskapsforum COVID-19 members were releasing models that turned out to be very inaccurate. 

For instance Nele Brusselaers released a model that predicted 96.000 people would die in Sweden by June with the current restrictions [[1]](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.11.20062133v1). That model wasn't feasible even when it was released, which lead to FHM and others not taking it seriously. Joacim Rocklov's model predicted that 19.000 to 50.000 would die [[2]](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.20.20039594v2.full.pdf). In exchanges with Tegnell, Cecilia Söderberg Nauclér estimated the IFR at 1.7% and estimated that 10,000 people in Stockholm would die by June [[3 - can't link]]. Ironically this group wrote a number of debate articles about how Sweden's health authority wasn't using ""advanced mathematical models"" to predict the spread. Even in late April they kept saying that Sweden had not seen the peak despite declining admissions to the ICU. 

While there is definitely a consensus culture in Sweden and a rally around the experts effect during the beginning of the pandemic, part of the reason some of these critics were dismissed were because they continuously released models that weren't plausible at the time and also turned out to be wrong. I believe that there is emails between Tegnell and someone else where they discuss Brusselaers' model and dismiss it because of its low quality. They were engaging slightly with this group. I think the author also overstates the effect within the scientific community, or at least the infectious disease control community, since the majority of the critics do not work with infectious disease. One of the founders and most prominent critics hasn't worked in medicine since the 1980s.

While it is a popular frame to paint the Swedish strategy as a failure, I think a more interesting question would be, why isn't it worse? Why were the models so inaccurate, why does Sweden have a lower excess mortality than the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, the UK? Why isn't Sweden seeing the rapid steep increase like Czechia or the Netherlands? Exploring that seems more prudent as more and more nations move away from a suppression strategy towards a mitigation strategy. 

Note, I think Sweden failed at the beginning to act quickly and having slightly stricter measures could have saved a lot of lives. The lack of testing from April to June was embarrassing. People were pretty relaxed until the second half of March. But now, looking forward, the Swedish experience might be useful to countries in trying to balance virus mitigation while keeping society moving and populations healthy in other regards.",2,t2_53hbxlwz,2020-10-09 13:32:42,/r/COVID19/comments/j7sg4h/swedens_gamble/g86vnke/,0

* Insanely strict lockdown protocols (proper ""only leave your house twice a day for food"" stuff) anytime someone in the local area as much as sneezes, the type no Western democracy would seriously tolerate;
* Mass testing of entire cities to stamp out clusters using methods such as pool testing - the mass testing of the 10m+ population of Wuhan in barely a week is an extraordinary triumph of logistics genuinely deserving of praise;
* Above all, extremely suspicious figures that eyewitnesses on the ground have claimed are a complete joke and massively hide just how bad things got in Wuhan during January/February, made even more confusing by them only including symptomatic cases in their official figures. The UK press have suggested that our government believes China are underreporting their case total by a factor of 10, which would put in nearer to a million, and even *that* doesn't really pass the smell test.

He's a definite voice of critical reason here. I have a question regarding why these scientists have a threshold of evidence that's lower than Osterholm's? What is happening in science?

Researchers talking about hydroxychloroquine's efficacy based on before/after trials had this similar issue. Upon closer inspection all of those trials fell apart and RCT revealed that HCQ wasn't efficacious in certain doses at certain times. VITAMINS trial revealed similar results for Sepsis and Vitamin C.

The idea is that this would be a mass produced test that everyone would take at home at the start of the day. If the test were to show that you're positive, you would isolate yourself until the test showed negative.

In order for this to be viable, you're going to need a test that:

a) can be performed at home with good repeatability and accuracy

b) can be manufactured and distributed cheaply and at scale

c) returns a result in a reasonable period of time, say half an hour

I think the press has got confused when talking about immunity, reading these studies claiming immunity lasts for 3-4 months and interpreting that to mean that it fades afterwards, when *that's only how long the study ran for* and not a comment on what will happen afterwards. Even then, antibodies alone are not the only part of the immune system - things like T-cell immunity come to our rescue after our antibodies fade.

Do we know exactly how long immunity lasts for? No. But I'm disappointed that ""immunity doesn't last and literally everyone is at risk of reinfection"" has seemingly become accepted in the last week or so and is being widely parroted both by the public (and certain Twitter health experts who should really know better), when reality is picture in far more complex.",1,t2_i1evx,2020-10-09 16:50:05,/r/COVID19/comments/j5juhf/weekly_question_thread_week_of_october_05/g876p3z/,0

1) PCR tests are generally acknowledged to be the most sensitive tests currently available (and it would be difficult to speed them up significantly or bring down the costs lower than what we now have.) Other types of tests, such as rapid antigen tests, have been criticized for not being sensitive enough.

2) Even despite this, PCR tests have relatively high levels of false negatives [even when patients are actively showing symptoms.](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-1495)

3) Infected people seem to be more contagious [in the presymptomatic stage](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5) and viral load seems to peak [at around the same time.](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.28.20202028v1) So you would have to reliably catch people in or prior to this stage i.e almost ""just"" after exposure to be reliable enough for what you want.

However, I will admit that _why_ PCR tests seem to be unreliable even with such high viral loads is a mystery to me, though also very likely well above my pay grade. And in science, very little is truly impossible. So it's possible there's a breakthrough for this.

Journalists presenting over-simplistic, catastrophised headlines is unfortunate enough, but inevitable; what disturbs me is the number of scientists who seem  to have thrown whatever integrity they may have had out of the window in favour of clickbait-titled opinion pieces. Add to that the poor quality of many of the preprint papers flying around, which associate anything and everything with Covid, make generalisations and unfounded assumptions as if they were going out of fashion, and throw numbers tatistics around like the ball on a roulette wheel...is this some kind of scientific mass hysteria, or are people using the present situation try to garner publicity for themselves, or has the quality of scientific research always been this haphazard and it's become more obvious because of the volume of papers at present?

There's plenty of good science being done, but it's getting increasingly buried by badly designed, ill-thought-out studies which under normal circumstances would never have been published. I understand the need to bypass some of the standard, glacially slow steps to publication, but this is a real public health crisis, not a theoretical sandbox for anyone with access to data to play in. Scientific integrity, rationality, and balance are needed now more than ever, to counteract the politics-ridden propaganda and dichotomous oversimplifications presented for public consumption by the media - so where is it? I know scientists are human, with human biases and fears, but isn't science as a \*discipline\* supposed to account for that? Isn't that what the scientific method is supposed to be for?

&gt;We also identified the evidence of enteric MERS-CoV infection in the stool specimen of a clinical patient. MERS-CoV was considerably resistant to fed-state gastrointestinal fluids but less tolerant to highly acidic fasted-state gastric fluid. In polarized Caco-2 cells cultured in Transwell inserts, apical MERS-CoV inoculation was more effective in establishing infection than basolateral inoculation. Notably, direct intragastric inoculation of MERS-CoV caused a lethal infection in human DPP4 transgenic mice.

People need to be able to conduct business. We can't all revert back to an agrarian society where we all become subsistence farmers and that's just life for the rest of time now. 

How do you maintain stay-at-home orders if people are being kicked out of their homes and forced out onto the street? How does the state afford to maintain a moratorium on evictions *forever?* Doctors don't have the answers to these questions, but those are questions that need to be answered if we decide to follow the Doctors' recommendations on public policy.

Public policy requires acceptable risk, and to a doctor there is no such thing as acceptable risk. You will most likely not get cancer if you smoke one cigar every six months. But a doctor will always tell you ""no cigars, ever."" You will most likely not develop obesity if you eat fast food once a month. But a doctor will tell you *never* to eat fast food.

Doctors can tell you what's healthy and what isn't. They can tell you the vectors for disease spread and the way to slow it. It's probably easy for the article author to demand we just social distance forever...even though we've literally *never* reacted that way to any other pandemic ever, and we've had many that were far, *far* deadlier.

People still die of the flu by the thousands every year, but we don't shut down our society because of it.

The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, is turning out to be one of the most devastating global pandemics in the history of humankind. There is a shortage of effective therapeutic strategies or preventative vaccines for this disease to date. A rigorous investigation is needed for identifying and developing more effective therapeutic strategies for COVID-19. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a crucial factor in COVID-19 pathogenesis, has been identified as a potential target for COVID-19 treatment.

Sweden and Norway, and to a degree Finland, are three rich, well educated, and relatively sparesely populated countries. They have similar cultures and population distribution. You'd expect Swedes and Norwegians to be responsible people who will take it upon themselves to wear a mask and not visit granny.

Now let's talk about the Netherlands. A very densely populated country with a number of dense hubs such as Rotterdam, Den Haag, Amsterdam, Utrecht, etc. They do not have the same attitude towards protecting themselves, with a cultural approach of 'meh, what happens happens we have doctors and stuff'. 

Lets extrapolate to France, who we can compare with Germany, and to a lesser degree Spain. The three countries are very similar, with Germany having a higher population, but also being on the richer side, and Spain on the poorer side (Spain has some huge dense population areas though). Why did Germany do better than Spain and France? Because Spain and France have a huge culture of Bistro/Tapas/Drinking/Partying/Bars/Social life all the time, whereas our German neighbours are more serious, work-driven, and know how to listen to the government who put clear measures in place (the French and Spanish authorities are ridiculous to be honest).

If I were to compare Sweden to anyone other than Denmark/Norway/Finland, I may as well start comparing France and the Czech Republic, or Spain and Austria. Makes 0 sense to be honest.

In all fairness, Sweden screwed-up the first wave yes, because their numbers are disgusting compared to their neighbours, but in a few years time, when this is all finally under control, we may look back and go ""shit, Sweden did much better on the 2nd, 4th and 6th waves"" ;)

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j7irwc,t1_g85gvho,g881zkb,"&gt; And that’d be somewhat compelling if not for the RCTs that reach opposite conclusions.

What RCTs are you referring to? I believe the consensus is that if masks are effective against the coronavirus, then the benefit probably comes mostly from protection against super-spreading strangers (and not people sharing the same household) at work, in stores, or in other public places, and at least as much from source control as from protection of the wearer. I've seen no RCTs that modeled this situation, and the logistics to do so--i.e., to ensure that not only the study participants but also all their public contacts wore masks--would seem very difficult.

I have seen RCTs testing protection of the wearer only, or protection of the wearer plus source control among household members. Those generally failed to reach a typical arbitrary cutoff for significance (e.g., p &lt; 5%). That's a quite different situation from the proposed two-sided benefit of universal mask use against the coronavirus, though. But even ignoring that difference, are you interpreting that as evidence that the masks don't work, vs. lack of evidence that the masks do work?

If yes, then I believe you've misunderstood the meaning of typical statistical tests for significance. p &gt; 5% means that if masks didn't actually work (the null hypothesis), then an effect at least as big as what was observed in the study might have been observed just by chance, due to random variation in the group. That might be because there's really no effect; but it might also be that the study was too small to distinguish the effect. The math that these studies do is entirely concerned with distinguishing ""masks work"" from ""either masks don't work, or our study is underpowered so we're unsure"". It would be possible to do math that distinguished among all three options (""work"", ""don't work"", ""unsure because the study is underpowered""), but I haven't seen any studies that did that.

Let's say we test mask and no-mask groups of 100 people each. In the no-mask group, 5/100 people get sick, and in the mask group 0/100 do. If you analyze this (properly with a Fisher exact test or something; or less properly by saying that if participants get sick with probability 5/200, then the probability that the 100 people wearing masks all don't get sick is ((200-5)/200)^100 = 8%, pretty close to Fisher's 6%), you'll find the result is not significant to p &lt; 5%. Once only five no-mask people got sick, there's literally no possible outcome that would have reached significance, no matter how perfectly the masks behaved. Statistical power is roughly proportional to the number of participants who get sick, not the total number of participants, so quite large groups would be required for any confidence. Several of the RCTs noted explicitly that their studies had less statistical power than they'd intended, because fewer people in either group got sick.

To be clear, I think the evidence that masks work is weak in either direction. The cost of mask use seems very small to me though, basically just the nuisance of wearing them--there's no evidence that any of the proposed risk compensation occurs, and weak evidence (like the Italians with the distance sensor belt, who concluded that a mask made people avoid them on the street) that it doesn't. Given that, mask use seems to me like a bet with very good expected value.",1,t2_6kgmb0p7,2020-10-09 23:17:02,/r/COVID19/comments/j7irwc/face_masks_what_the_data_say/g881zkb/,0

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j5juhf,t1_g86ggkv,g883c0s,"Too add to what was already said, here's what we know about other viruses in the same genus, that's important to keep in mind. There are 7 coronaviruses that have been identified in humans. Three are novel pathogens that have been known to cause high rates of severe respiratory disease, but of those three only SARS-CoV-2 has spread easily enough to become a pandemic. There are also four that are *endemic.* Everyone gets all four of them by age 6, and then is typically reinfected once every few years (maybe getting one or two of the four each year) allowing them to sustain themselves in the population. These reinfections are *usually* asymptomatic or cause a minor cough/cold, but some very small percentage of the time, they cause pneumonia and even death. (The initial infection is also generally mild, but the same is true for SARS-CoV-2 in children aged 1-10.)

This is kind of the nature of respiratory diseases, immunologically. Your respiratory tract is a hospitable place for viruses to continue to cause occasional mild illness even if you have prior immunity to them preventing them from getting a toehold into your bloodstream and infecting other organs.

If you've had a recent SARS-CoV-2 infection, like within six months or so, we know that reinfection of any form is very unlikely. In the coming months or years, after the acute pandemic is beaten, we may well see infections return - however it is less likely that previously infected (or vaccinated) people will have severe, systemic disease, purely based on what we know other viruses do. That said, researchers are still working to identify what makes this virus ""special"" or if it has the ability to escape immunity in ways that others in its family don't.

In the meantime because most people are still immunologically naive we're all still at some risk of severe disease regardless.",1,t2_593zf,2020-10-09 23:28:32,/r/COVID19/comments/j5juhf/weekly_question_thread_week_of_october_05/g883c0s/,0

Covid-19 positive patients in the State. Secretary Health Shri. Amit Satija, IAS, 
Director, Department Health Services Dr. Jose D’sa, Director, Directorate of Food 
and Drugs Administration, Smt. Jyoti Sardessai and Dean, Goa Medical College, 
Dr. Shivanand Bandekar were present on the occasion. 

These kits will be available for free at all Urban &amp; Primary Health Centres 
for any Covid-19 positive patient in the State who opts for Home Isolation. **The kit 
contains Pulse Oximeter (1 no.), Digital Thermometer (1 no.), Paracetamol tablets 
(15 nos.), Vitamin C tablets (30 nos.), Multivitamin tablets with Zinc (30 nos.), 
Vitamin D3 tablets (2 packs), Ivermectin 12mg tablets (10 nos.), Doxycycline 
100mg tablets (10 nos.), Three-ply face masks (5 nos.), N-95 Masks (2 nos.), 
Sanitizer (100ml), Alcohol based Wipes (1 box with 20 plies) and Gloves (2 pairs).**

While speaking on the occasion the Chief Minister welcomed the idea of 
Home Isolation monitoring kits. He appreciated the work being done by doctors at 
all the CHCs, PHCs and UHCs in the State and congratulated them. “There are 
ample facilities for Covid-19 positive patients in the State and people need not 
panic. These days more people are opting for Home Isolation. This kit will prove 
to be a game changer for all those. Currently there are 3500 home isolations in the 
State. The Government is planning its best to standardize post Covid-19 
management services. AYUSH Ministry has formed a standard protocol for the 
same and this Government shall train its doctors hired under AYUSH in the best 
possible way to provide Post Covid-19 management,” the Chief Minister said.
Throwing light on the achievements of the medical faculty during the tough 
times during past few months, the Chief Minister informed that 150 natural and 
caesarean deliveries were carried out at the ESI Hospital, Margao and mother and 
Children are safe and healthy. The doctors have even carried out a caesarean on a 
Corona positive woman. No casualties were recorded during these child births. 
People should look at such positive stories rather than panicking about the 
scenario. Many patients with co-morbid conditions have recovered from Covid-19 
and are living a very healthy life,” the Chief Minister said.

Informing that the South Goa District Hospital is now functioning in full 
swing and the number of beds will be upgraded soon, Minister for Health Shri. 
Rane stated that the Home Isolation Monitoring Kit is made available considering 
the poor patients who cannot afford to buy a kit worth Rs. 2000/-. “The DHS with 
the help of Auxiliary Nursing Midwifery (ANM) and Multi Purpose Health Worker (MPHW) and Goa Electronics Limited make 2600 phone calls in a day to check the saturation 
level of each patient. These calls further help doctors to make the right decision in treating the patients. 
The State has acquired best models to manage the spread of pandemic and continue to do so,” he said.
The function was attended by Medical Officers around the State. Earlier Dr. 
Bandekar welcomed the gathering. Dr Dayanand Rao compered the function while 
Dr. D’sa proposed the vote of thanks.

&gt;  
&gt;The  SARS-CoV-2 pandemic currently prevails worldwide. To understand the  immunological signature of SARS-CoV-2 infections and aid the search for  treatments and vaccines, comprehensive characterization of adaptive  immune responses towards SARS-CoV-2 is needed. We investigated the  breadth and potency of antibody-, and T-cell immune responses, in 203  recovered SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who presented with asymptomatic  to severe infections. We report very broad serological profiles with  cross-reactivity to other human coronaviruses. Further, &gt;99% had  SARS-CoV-2 epitope specific antibodies, with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization  and spike-ACE2 receptor interaction blocking observed in 95% of  individuals. A significant positive correlation between spike-ACE2  blocking antibody titers and neutralization potency was observed.  SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8+ T-cell responses were clear and quantifiable in  90% of HLA-A2+ individuals. The viral surface spike protein was  identified as the dominant target for both neutralizing antibodies and  CD8+ T cell responses. Overall, the majority of patients had robust  adaptive immune responses, regardless of disease severity. These data  support the possibility of achieving protective immunity through natural  infection and bode well for the prospects of inducing immunological  memory through vaccination.",1,t2_s6x1h,2020-10-09 23:40:39,/r/COVID19/comments/j810jx/sarscov2_elicits_robust_adaptive_immune_responses/g884rvr/,0

There's a lot in there, but the bottom line is this. In autoimmune disorders, we routinely see an overwhelming antibody response that develops in a way that is fundamentally different from the ones you see in a 'normal' setting like vaccination. This alternate system of immune development is more inflammatory, more prone to making mistakes, and ultimately, associated with poor disease outcomes. It also suggests that in patients with these kinds of responses, we may need to do more in terms of modulating their immune systems to protect against immune-linked pathology.",1,t2_77ut6,2020-10-10 01:06:32,/r/COVID19/comments/j6sx2o/extrafollicular_b_cell_responses_correlate_with/g88f425/,0

It would appear that ivermectin's broad-spectrum antiviral activity is related to its ability to target the host importin (IMP) α/β1, which are nuclear transport proteins responsible for HIV integrase and DENV NS5 entry to the nucleus [17].

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j81ti6,t3_j81ti6,g88mx3x,"Another paper that supposedly debunks HCQ, and then when you dig in to the methods you find them prescribing it improperly YET AGAIN.

1) HCQ was given to *hospitalized* patients.  

This is too late, if your symptoms are bad enough to warrant admission to a hospital then HCQ will not benefit you.  Ideally it is prescribed in an outpatient setting at the earliest possible time, even before a confirmed test if symptoms warrant a clinical diagnosis of covid.  The earlier the better.

76% of patients in the study were already requiring oxygen, this is inexcusable for a drug largely meant as a preventative.

2)  HCQ was administered alone (without zinc).

It is well documented that HCQ requires zinc supplementation to have maximum effects.  Why did the study leave it out?

3) The study used any patient over 18.

HCQ likely does not benefit young and relatively healthy patients, as their risk of mortality is already extremely low.  It’s uncommon to see a statistically different change in mortality with any drug given to an 18 year old (hard to claim that lowering the death rate from 0.0002 to 0.0001 was statistically significant, because it’s not).  

HCQ needs to be given to elderly patients with comorbidities to see a statistical impact.  By including anyone under 40 you’re impacting the data.  

A full 60% of the patient we’re under 70 years old, we’re not told how many were in their 20s 30s and 40s.

I’m not some HCQ truther, but it’s absurd we haven’t had a proper peer-reviewed study addressing these 3 key issues.  A study like that does not yet exist, and having more and more faulty studies like this one does nothing to bring proper conclusion, so stop pretending it does.

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j7sg4h,t1_g87tqis,g88n20w,"This is a good point. There are several features which will limit any epidemic in most nordic countries and also some interesting details which are only true for some countries.

These include:

* Low birth rate -&gt; lots of singles -&gt; small households sizes.
* Almost no inter generational living, kids move out when they turn 18 and that's it
* Usually you can have 3-4 sick days just by saying your sick and that's it - full pay. And this is unlimited - it will not affect your 4-6 weeks of paid vacations in any way. Very easy to just stay at home if you just feel you're coming up with something. In professional jobs people might still work, but do it remotely even if they didn't plan it that day - just to be safe.
* Centrally coordinated healthcare might be able to offer better testing and tracking. However, it seems to be failing even in Finland at the moment as the delays are now days. Long delays in testing have usually resulted in unchecked spread everywhere because it makes tracking &amp; isolation useless.
* Universal healthcare: Most lifestyle diseases are held in check and even the poorest are taken care of. Diabetes and cardiovascular disease is monitored even if you have no money at all.
* The number of service and manual industrial jobs is relatively small so more people can work remotely when needed. The downside is that the unemployment numbers in Finland for example are massive even without the pandemic. After this they will be catastrophic.

TL;DR: On average the people can take a lot more abuse from a disease without dying and the pensioner-aged people are more easily isolated. Testing and tracking seems to work better with centralized control. The service &amp; manual job sector is relatively small and the unemployed are ""naturally"" isolated.

However, there's also one epidemic driver with universal healthcare: 99%+ people do not die of covid, so having a ""bad trip"" with the disease isn't probably going to affect you that much since the care will cost you maybe a hundred bucks. This might encourage careless behavior in people who are fine with dying if the dice rolls badly or think that it's improbable that they would die. Some people with severe disease might have long term consequences, but it looks like most will recover just fine.

US style healthcare with massive bills and all kinds of limitations and deductibles even if you have insurance makes people afraid of getting ill - even if it wouldn't hurt them in the long term physically.

Regarding Sweden - I think we need to wait at least a year or two still to evaluate the end results in comparison to similar nordic countries.",3,t2_i1pz8,2020-10-10 02:15:52,/r/COVID19/comments/j7sg4h/swedens_gamble/g88n20w/,0

Conclusion:  
""Disposable medical masks (also known as surgical masks) are  loose-fitting devices that were designed to be worn by medical personnel  to protect accidental contamination of patient wounds, and to protect  the wearer against splashes or sprays of bodily fluids ([*36*](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article#r36)).  There is limited evidence for their effectiveness in preventing  influenza virus transmission either when worn by the infected person for  source control or when worn by uninfected persons to reduce exposure.  Our systematic review found no significant effect of face masks on  transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza.""",1,t2_5bb19jt5,2020-10-10 02:56:17,/r/COVID19/comments/j7irwc/face_masks_what_the_data_say/g88rlm6/,0
COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j7irwc,t3_j7irwc,g88rrlj,"From the beginning of the whole mask debate, it always seemed pretty straightforward that a barrier in front of the mouth and nose is unlikely to *potentiate* the ingress and egress of droplets, or rather it would require a *very* extraordinary explanation for that to have been the case. Is that line of reasoning unscientific? If your definition of scientific is “supported by a formal data set,” sure, maybe, but this turns into semantics, because even if it’s unscientific, it’s not irrational or an affront to logic. The reductio ad absurdum of “once we start giving a pass to thought processes like that then ten seconds later we’ll be condoning witchcraft” never really seemed to apply or make sense. I get that we need data for the purpose of convincing stubborn people who like to poke holes in everything, and on *other* important questions there stands a likelihood of being unknowns and “things we don’t know we don’t know” as well as higher stakes, but for rational folks who are acting in good faith, specifically on the narrow question of masks, chastising these people for being “rational but not scientific” just seemed counterproductive.

There’s a cheekiness to the parachute analogy that rubs people the wrong way and in turn foments a backlash against it, but I don’t see why it’s fundamentally unsound if you factor out the sort of “punk off-roading” vibe it exudes.",1,t2_860eeam4,2020-10-10 02:57:47,/r/COVID19/comments/j7irwc/face_masks_what_the_data_say/g88rrlj/,0

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j2plcg,t1_g775rrr,g88umhl,"&gt;That is the garbage survey-study by Boulware.  
&gt;  
&gt;They did not personally evaluate participants.  Participants self-reported!  In this highly  convoluted environment what was keeping activists from participating dishonestly in the study?  
&gt;  
&gt;Selected notes after reading the study a couple months ago:  
&gt;  
&gt;Only 10% of participants were black or Hispanic but they make up roughly 30% of US population and have suffered disproportionately.  
&gt;  
&gt;They say the study was not for high risk patients.  So why even do such a study since almost no one who is not high-risk dies from COVID?  
&gt;  
&gt;Outcomes in both groups were remarkably good.  There were no deaths and only 2 participants were hospitalized.  
&gt;  
&gt;How well does this participant group reflect the general population?  
&gt;  
&gt;Garbage in, garbage out.  
&gt;  
&gt;The study did not include zinc or AZT that Dr. Zelenko and other early adopters of HCQ had been using.  The early adopters were reporting encouraging benefits.  Why not do a larger and more highly-controlled study of the protocol used by the early adopters of HCQ?  
&gt;  
&gt;In contrast the Scholtz-Zelenko study of HCQ along with zinc and AZT reported an 84% reduction in hospitalization.    https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202007.0025/v1  
&gt;  
&gt;Other groups of researchers re-analyzed the raw data from the Boulware studies and came up with very different conclusions!  The following are excerpts from the researchers presented here.  
&gt;  
&gt;""The McGill \[-Boulware\] researchers had only looked for statistical significance after 1 day, 2 days, 3 days or 4 days, and did not find any.  ""  
&gt;  
&gt;France Soir, with the assistance of these researchers, redid the maths of the first Boulware study.  
&gt;  
&gt;"".. patients were asked to self-report symptoms, time was needed to process the demands, and then the medications and placebos were sent by courier, with study participants all over the US and Canada – all elements contributing to delay the administration of the drug. ""  
&gt;  
&gt;""hidden in the supplementary material lies the fact that they lost track of 69 participants of “unknown vital status,” some of which may have died.""  
&gt;  
&gt;“We conclude their randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial presents statistical evidence, at 99% confidence level, that the treatment of Covid-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine is effective...""  
&gt;  
&gt;“For 0 to 2 days after exposure to virus, the estimated relative reduction in symptomatic outcomes is 72% after 0 days, 48.9% after 1 day and 29.3% after 2 days.”

You may actually be at an advantage, but IgG1 is normally the most abundant type anyway, so your condition probably makes no difference and this paper likely points to the effects of an IgG1 deficiency.

IgG1-biased antibodies were associated with lower disease severity, and better neutralization, which is the ability of antibodies to not just act as a ""tag"" for effector cells, but to actually disable the virus directly.

The total mortality for the flu season 2019/2020 in Sweden is on track to be the *second lowest in recorded history*, which combined with the fact that the demographics of the covid19 dead aren't different from normal death demographics, means that this year simply hasn't been a disaster.  It might look scary with a new and unfamiliar cause of death, but if the total all-cause deaths is on par with previous years, then nothing really changed.

So it's not a disaster. It's not a failure.

The model that I favor personally is that there is an initial defect in viral control for a variety of potential reasons (IFN-gamma deficiency would be one mechanism). Regardless, due to a failure at that initial control point, inflammation ramps up and the antibody response would try to play 'catch-up', pumping antibodies that haven't been well-selected through that extrafollicular pathway. In some patients that would lead to control, but in others you could get a variety of off-target effects due to mis-targeting. In that way, you would get a second round of pathology in some patients that would be more 'autoimmune-like' in nature, and potentially more treatable with the drugs we currently employ in diseases like lupus.

Clinical Trial of Ivermectin Plus Doxycycline for the Treatment of Confirmed Covid-19 Infection

Dr. Reaz Mahmud, Dhaka Medical College


Summary:

- 183 patients in ivermectin+doxycycline (plus standard of care) arm - Ivermectin 6mg x 2 tablets = 12mg (given once i.e. total 12mg dose) - Doxycycline 100mg x 2 tablets/day (given for 5 days i.e. total 1000mg dose)

- 180 patients in placebo arm (standard of care)

----

Ivermectin+Doxycycline arm had:

- older demographic (usually do worse)

- more males (usually do worse)

----

Mortality:

- 0 deaths in ivermectin+doxycycline arm

- 3 deaths in placebo arm

----

Number of Patients With Early Clinical Improvement (at 7 days):

- 60.7% patients in ivermectin+doxycycline arm

- 44.4% patients in placebo arm

- p value &lt; 0.03

- (i.e. placebo did worse)

----

Number of Participants With Late Clinical Recovery (requiring more than 14 days to recover):

- 23% patients in ivermectin+doxycycline arm

- 37.2% patients in placebo arm

- p value &lt; 0.004

- (i.e. placebo did worse)

----

Number of Patients Having Clinical Deterioration (1 month):

- 8.7% patients in ivermectin+doxycycline arm

- 17.8% patients in placebo arm

- p value &lt; 0.013

- (i.e. placebo did worse)

----

Number of Patients Remain Persistently Positive for RT-PCR of Covid-19 (at day 14):

- 7.7% patients in ivermectin+doxycycline arm

- 20.0% patients in placebo arm

- p value &lt; 0.001

- (i.e. placebo did worse)

----

Adverse Events:

- 2 patients had gastrointestinal issues (Erosive esophagitis) in ivermectin+doxycycline arm

- 0 patients in placebo arm


Minor adverse events:

- 7 patients had gastrointestinal issues (Non ulcer Dyspepsia) in ivermectin+doxycycline arm

- 0 patients in placebo arm

----


Takeaways:

- Ivermectin + Doxycycline had better outcomes

- Ivermectin dose was only 6mg x 2 tablets = 12mg (given once) - which is at the lower end of dosage for covid-19 (although it is typical for de-worming).  Other studies have typically used 2x or 3x this dosage or higher.  Also it is not clear if Ivermectin was taken with a fatty meal (which ivermectin spec sheet gives 2.5x bioavailability when taken with fatty meal).

- Results are better than what we have seen for Remdesivir etc. - yet are getting scant attention (also lower interest in clinical trials by pharma since being generic drugs there is little financial incentive).  Most of the work on Ivermectin is thus coming from outside the U.S./Europe (Bangladesh, Peru, Egypt).",3,t2_91eig,2020-10-10 05:00:51,/r/COVID19/comments/j80jdk/clinical_trial_of_ivermectin_plus_doxycycline_for/g8958g5/,0

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j7irwc,t1_g88rlm6,g89a6to,"Were my points above clear to you? I'm thinking not, since I don't see anything in that meta-analysis addressing them. With a cursory look through the studies (most of which I'd already seen, some not), I see no studies where both the participant and all their public contacts wore masks--either only the participants wore masks, or the participants plus contacts at home wore masks. Do you see any? If not, why do you think this is representative of the current mask orders for coronavirus, given the theory that most of the benefit from masks is from source control in public?

But even ignoring that, from the meta-analysis:

&gt; In pooled analysis, we found no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.51–1.20; I2 = 30%, p = 0.25) (Figure 2). 

In other words, people who wore masks got sick 0.78x as often as people who didn't; but the statistical power of the meta-analysis was weak enough that this still might have happened 25% of the time by chance if masks are ineffective. So they reject the result as insignificant, because 25% is greater than the common but arbitrary threshold of 5%.

But regardless of what threshold we choose, this meta-analysis is evidence in favor of masks working! Whatever you believed about the probability that masks work before you read that study, afterward you should be slightly more confident that they do (or less confident that they don't). It's just not strong enough evidence to reach p &lt; 5%. Anyone who thinks this means we have ""RCTs that reach opposite conclusions"" has simply misunderstood the math--even if we disregard any result that doesn't reach p &lt; 5%, this meta-analysis shows the absence of evidence, not evidence of absence.

The meta-analysis itself notes this!

&gt; Most studies were underpowered because of limited sample size, and some studies also reported suboptimal adherence in the face mask group.

I've repeatedly seen studies showing weak (p &gt; 5%) evidence that masks work presented as if they're strong evidence that masks don't work.

I just wanted to clarify this point. Melbourne Australia will be locked down for 11 consecutive weeks for the second wave and had only had a period of a few weeks at the end of the first wave in June that you were permitted to see friends and family.

- mandatory masks everywhere outside home ($200 penalty)
- no travel outside the city ($5000 penalty)
- maximum 1 hour a day exercise outdoors ($1652 penalty. Now 2 hours)
- maximum of 2 people meeting outdoors (now 5 people from 2 households) ($1652 penalty)
- only 1 person per household permitted to go shopping for groceries at a maximum of once a day (lifted a week ago)
- all gyms closed, most skate and exercise equipment at parks closed, most retail closed, no eat in restaurants, only take away within 5km of home or delivery.

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j899fz,t3_j899fz,g89gxxs,"&gt; **Abstract**
&gt; 
&gt; Background 

&gt;In a previous randomised controlled trial (RCT) in hospital healthcare workers (HCWs), cloth masks resulted in a higher risk of respiratory infections compared with medical masks. This was the only published RCT of cloth masks at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic.
&gt; 
&gt; Objective 

&gt;To do a post hoc analysis of unpublished data on mask washing and mask contamination from the original RCT to further understand poor performance of the two-layered cotton cloth mask used by HCWs in that RCT.
&gt; 
&gt; Setting 

&gt;14 secondary-level/tertiary-level hospitals in Hanoi, Vietnam.
&gt; 
&gt; Participants 

&gt;A subgroup of 607 HCWs aged ≥18 years working full time in selected high-risk wards, who used a two-layered cloth mask and were part of a randomised controlled clinical trial comparing medical masks and cloth masks.
&gt; 
&gt; Intervention 

&gt;Washing method for cloth masks (self-washing or hospital laundry). A substudy of contamination of a sample of 15 cloth and medical masks was also conducted.
&gt; 
&gt; Outcome measure 

&gt;Infection rate over 4 weeks of follow up and viral contamination of masks tested by multiplex PCR.
&gt; 
&gt; Results 

&gt;Viral contamination with rhinovirus was identified on both used medical and cloth masks. Most HCW (77% of daily washing) self-washed their masks by hand. The risk of infection was more than double among HCW self-washing their masks compared with the hospital laundry (HR 2.04 (95% CI 1.03 to 4.00); p=0.04). There was no significant difference in infection between HCW who wore cloth masks washed in the hospital laundry compared with medical masks (p=0.5).
&gt; 
&gt; Conclusions 

&gt;Using self-reported method of washing, we showed double the risk of infection with seasonal respiratory viruses if masks were self-washed by hand by HCWs. The majority of HCWs in the study reported hand-washing their mask themselves. This could explain the poor performance of two layered cloth masks, if the self-washing was inadequate. Cloth masks washed in the hospital laundry were as protective as medical masks. Both cloth and medical masks were contaminated, but only cloth masks were reused in the study, reiterating the importance of daily washing of reusable cloth masks using proper method. A well-washed cloth mask can be as protective as a medical mask.",1,t2_7755hegr,2020-10-10 06:54:15,/r/COVID19/comments/j899fz/contamination_and_washing_of_cloth_masks_and_risk/g89gxxs/,0

This piece you've cited isn't supporting ivermectin as a COVID drug. In fact, it's saying it's unlikely to be one. From their prior blog post:

&gt;The mechanism of action of ivermectin in parasitic infections is thought to be inhibition of anion flux through a glutamate-controlled chloride channel present in the parasites, killing them by neurotoxicity. But the channel is not found in humans. Nor in viruses. Mechanisms, however, can always be conjured up. Here’s one from the same thread of comments:

&gt;Importin (IMP) α/β1 30 is a heterodimer that binds to the SARS-CoV-2 cargo protein and moves it into the nucleus which reduces the host cell antiviral response. Ivermectin destabilizes the Impα/β1 heterodimer, prevents it from viral protein binding and thus from entering the nucleus.

&gt;**This, perhaps convincing sounding mechanism, based on some in vitro evidence in other viruses, has been dusted off, with apparent authority, to explain the action of ivermectin in covid-19. But we have no evidence that this proposed mechanism is at all relevant (Figure 2). In fact, it can’t be relevant, because (spoiler alert) SARS-CoV-2 doesn’t enter the nucleus to replicate; it replicates in the cytoplasm.**",1,t2_84pge,2020-10-10 07:26:10,/r/COVID19/comments/j80jdk/clinical_trial_of_ivermectin_plus_doxycycline_for/g89k3ug/,0

Right. So what? The mechanism as described a couple posts up, is ivermectin blocking the entry of virus-generated proteins into the nucleus, so the cell's immune function isn't damaged. That's where the various mechanisms are laid out. It's missing a couple because it was written months back.

Did you read the comment on the blog post, the one that I linked to, not the one you're quoting?

Some allege that ivermectin stops the virus from replicating, even though it's an RNA virus and doesn't need to replicate in the nucleus. I don't know the basis for that.

From what I understand, the problem is that the large scale Covid testing isn’t being performed by scientists carefully reviewing amplification plots of samples- they’re designed to be a fast as possible and just give technicians a yes or no answer. I don’t see reporting CT values for patients on a large scale as realistic.

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j8eabw,t3_j8eabw,g8ad8ca,"The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), part of the Department of Health, has granted a provisional determination to AstraZeneca Pty Ltd in relation to its COVID-19 Vaccine, ChAd0x1-S [recombinant].

The granting of a provisional determination means that the TGA has made a decision that AstraZeneca is now eligible to apply for provisional registration for the vaccine in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG).

Provisional determination is the first step in the process and does not mean that an application has or will be made, or that the vaccine will be provisionally approved for inclusion in the ARTG.

Normally for a vaccine to be registered in Australia, a sponsor (usually a pharmaceutical company) is required to submit a complete and comprehensive package of data to the TGA. A formal evaluation is then carried out in multiple stages by technical experts, prior to a decision being made.

The provisional pathway provides a formal and transparent mechanism for speeding up the registration of promising new medicines with preliminary clinical data. In order to apply for provisional registration, the sponsor must first apply for a provisional determination. Further information on eligibility criteria can be found at: Provisional determination: A step-by-step guide for prescription medicines.

In making its decision to grant AstraZeneca a provisional determination, the TGA considered all eligibility criteria, including factors such as the evidence of a plan to submit comprehensive clinical data and the seriousness of the current COVID-19 pandemic.

In addition to this determination, the TGA is actively monitoring COVID-19 vaccine development that is occurring both in Australia and around the world, and is part of a network of international regulators that meet regularly to discuss the development of COVID-19 vaccines and the establishment of systems for monitoring the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines once they have reached the market. The ability to access early data and planned collaboration with international regulators will assist the TGA to expedite the evaluation of any new vaccines without compromising on our strict requirements for safety, quality and effectiveness of products.",1,t2_4tmsh269,2020-10-10 12:36:00,/r/COVID19/comments/j8eabw/tga_grants_provisional_determination_for_covid19/g8ad8ca/,0

So what happens is the world has a solid ""factory line"" of how to produce a flu vaccine (because they've got that down to a science after decades of making them) - they just need to know the _exact_ strain to produce. Committees meet up every year to try to figure out which strains will be most common the following year, and tell the manufacturers to make those.

Newton was very much able to test his ideas and found them to be true (within the realms of the measurement accuracy available to him). 

Einstein hypothesised, but his ideas have been tested since through experimentation, such as gravity probes A/B. Even then, his reasonings were based on others experimental evidence.

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j7oyip,t1_g86j70p,g8benkc,"&gt;RNA extraction and qPCR do not take 24 hours.

No, it doesn't, but here are the things that increase time: 

1)Time in transportation. How far the lab is, and how often they send the samples to the lab. They may only send their samples to the lab once a day at the end of the day, especially if the testing site is farther away. Then of course the time is takes to actually get to the lab.

2) Time for the lab to sort through all the samples once they arrive. We don't just get covid samples. We make sure that all the information on the container holding the sample is correct.

3) We can then mark the test as received in the lab (takes times when there are hundreds of samples) in the computer by scanning each one individually. 

4) We can now start the testing which takes about 5 hours if you include pipetting and DNA extraction and the pcr time itself. Because it takes 5 hours, we run numerous patients at one time, which means that if we only have 5 samples first thing in the morning, we're going to wait for more samples to arrive before we actually run the test.

5) Finally before results are reported, they are all manually reviewed to make sure they all make sense. If any don't, we repeat the testing process either for that particular sample, or the entire batch if they suspect a systematic issue.

All of this, for hundreds of samples means that turn around time increases. We also have limited space, only a certain number of machines that can perform the test, only a limited number of individuals who can do the tests (we have a huge shortage of lab techs where I am). We also have other tests to run on top of covid. The volume of testing needed is like nothing we've seen for a very long time, so we're having to buy new machines that can accommodate the larger volume. But those new machines need to be validated to make sure they are functioning properly and giving correct results.

Objective: This study examined the associations between type-2 diabetes (T2DM) and self-reported/familial COVID-19 infection and investigated health-related outcomes among those with diabetes during China's nationwide quarantine. Research Design and Methods: The 2020 China COVID-19 Survey was administered anonymously via social media (WeChat) across China. It was completed by 10,545 adults in all of mainland China's 31 provinces. The survey consisted of 74 items covering sociodemographic characteristics, preventive measures for COVID-19, lifestyle behaviors, and health-related outcomes during the period of quarantine. Regression models examined associations among study variables, adjusting for covariates. Results: Diabetes was associated with a six-fold increased risk of reporting COVID-19 infection among respondents or their family members. Among patients with diabetes, individuals who rarely wore masks had double the risk of suspected COVID-19 infection compared with those who always wore masks, with an inverse J-shaped relationship between face mask wearing and suspected COVID-19 infection. People with T2DM tended to have both poor knowledge of COVID-19 and poor compliance with preventive measures, despite perceiving a high risk of personal infection (40.0% among respondents reporting T2DM and 8.0% without T2DM). Only 54-55% of these respondents claimed to consistently practice preventive measures, including wearing face masks. Almost 60% of those with T2DM experienced food or medication shortages during the quarantine period, which was much higher than those without T2DM (22.7 % and 25.8%, respectively). Importantly, respondents who experienced medication shortages reported a 63% higher COVID-19 infection rate. Conclusions: T2DM was associated with an increased risk of self-reported personal and family member COVID-19 infection, which is mitigated by consistent use of face masks.",1,t2_1jopkpkc,2020-10-10 21:50:47,/r/COVID19/comments/j8dpbw/covid19_type2_diabetes_and_associated_health/g8bkdxy/,0

All the media article says is 160 patients (which is SMALL) and 126 patients were non-hospitalized (it was very difficult to be hospitalized in the UK in the early days, so not surprising) - which is WAY too small to make any sort of strong conclusions on. You wouldn't say that out of 160 people, 126 of them liked green M&amp;Ms and of those, 10% were axe murderers, so therefore 10% of any population are axe murderers. But ultimately, I take the position of ICL's Professor Darrel Francis (an extremely good follow on Twitter at @profdfrancis) on the German COVID myocarditis paper that ultimately shut down (and then...un-shut down) NCAA football: MRIs see stuff everywhere, and without a pre-COVID baseline, you have no idea if what you're seeing is because of the virus or because of a patient's pre-existing risk factors.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)  rapidly spread around the globe after its emergence in Wuhan in  December 2019. With no specific therapeutic and prophylactic options  available, the virus has infected millions of people of which more than  half a million succumbed to the viral disease, COVID-19. The urgent need  for an effective treatment together with a lack of small animal  infection models has led to clinical trials using repurposed drugs  without preclinical evidence of their in vivo efficacy. We established  an infection model in Syrian hamsters to evaluate the efficacy of small  molecules on both infection and transmission. Treatment of  SARS-CoV-2−infected hamsters with a low dose of favipiravir or  hydroxychloroquine with(out) azithromycin resulted in, respectively, a  mild or no reduction in virus levels. However, high doses of favipiravir  significantly reduced infectious virus titers in the lungs and markedly  improved lung histopathology. Moreover, a high dose of favipiravir  decreased virus transmission by direct contact, whereas  hydroxychloroquine failed as prophylaxis. Pharmacokinetic modeling of  hydroxychloroquine suggested that the total lung exposure to the drug  did not cause the failure. Our data on hydroxychloroquine (together with  previous reports in macaques and ferrets) thus provide no scientific  basis for the use of this drug in COVID-19 patients. In contrast, the  results with favipiravir demonstrate that an antiviral drug at nontoxic  doses exhibits a marked protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 in a small  animal model. Clinical studies are required to assess whether a similar  antiviral effect is achievable in humans without toxic effects.",1,t2_rpjo0,2020-10-11 01:17:09,/r/COVID19/comments/j8o9lr/favipiravir_at_high_doses_has_potent_antiviral/g8caa9y/,0

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j8ol5d,t3_j8ol5d,g8cftq1,"&gt;**Discussions:**

&gt;Andersen and colleagues documented the possible natural origin of SARS-CoV-2 from BatCoV RaTG13 ^1,2 . SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh zoonotic CoV virus capable of infecting humans, but the first and only human coronavirus (HCoV) with pandemic potential ^3 . Bat or rodent CoVs demonstrate  certain specific changes in the S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), as well as the S protein glycan-binding N-terminal domain (NTD), during host tropism/adaptation ^4,5 . SARS-CoV-2, unlike other CoVs, does not have those signature changes, suggesting that these RBD and NTD subdomains are of very recent origin. 

&gt;The ""Canyon Hypothesis"" explains the development of canyons, depression zones or cavities on the surfaces of influenza virus, human rhinovirus, and Meningo viruses ^6 . In CoVs (except SARS-CoV-2), the S protein NTD domain has several predicted glycan-binding domains, with a common feature being the hidden localization of these glycan binding domains to cavities to limit their access to antibodies and immune cells ^5 . This pattern of CoVs is thought to be an evolutionary measure to restrict the recognition of these active sites by host immune system ^4 .

&gt;HCoVs can evade detection by host glycan-binding immune receptors. Comparative genomic analysis of six HCoVs with their corresponding native bat or rodent CoVs suggests compatibility with the ""Canyon Hypothesis"" resulting from various adaptive S protein NTD non-synonymous mutations near or at the glycan binding domain which are predicted to result in these NTD domains being hidden below the protein surface ^5 . The predicted flat, non-sunken pattern of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein NTD glycan binding domains conflicts with this evolutionary host tropism/adaptation strategy ^7 . 

&gt;A template-switching mechanism is presumably responsible for the high rate of RNA recombination in CoVs. In host cells, CoV RNAs show discontinuous RNA synthesis materialized by pauses of the RNA-dependent complex and subsequent jumps to downstream template acceptor sequences. This process results in subgenomic minus strand RNAs which serve as templates for subgenomic mRNAs. Due to the mechanistic similarity to recombination, this process might be at the origin of recombinant CoVs co-opting other CoV or even host related sequences ^8 . Instances include the mouse hepatitis coronavirus S protein NTD sialic acid binding domain, likely arising from recombination of viral RNA with human galectin RNA sequences ^8 .

&gt;The furin recognition motif present at the SARS-CoV2 S1/S2 junction has no analogy in other ""linage B"" beta-coronaviruses, including neither  pangolin-CoV  nor  RaTG13 ^1 . This indicates that the S protein S1/S2 junction is not a hot spot for RNA recombination termination that depends on a pattern swapping templates (copy-choice) ^8 . Additionally, clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2 S protein have not indicated any further recombination in this S1/S2 area, suggesting that the addition of a motif for S1/S2 site furin cleavage constituted a unique recombination occurrence. Finally, the CoV-unique insertion of 4 amino-acids creating a novel RRAR furin cleavage site introduces two arginine codons CGG-CGG, whose usage is extremely rare in CoVs, further supporting the hypothesis of a unique recombination occurrence.

&gt;HCoVs have high-frequency “hot spots” for non-synonymous amino acid replacements that can  possibly create positive selection for host tropism/adaptation, resistance to neutralizing antibodies, or immune evasion ^2 . Interestingly, clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolates to date have only a single high frequency non-synonymous mutation, D614G, in their S protein ^9 . Based on currently known mutation rates and patterns in clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2, the S protein does not appear to be a mutational “hot spot” for SARS-CoV-2, unlike other human CoVs.  

&gt;SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh HCoV, but the first HCoV with pandemic potential. SARS-CoV disappeared without a pandemic, and MERS-CoV is mostly endemic to the Arabian Peninsula with some additional limited traveler infections resulting in outbreaks in South Korea ^3,4 . These unique features of SARS-CoV-2 raise several questions concerning the proximal origin of the virus that require further discussion.

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j899fz,t1_g89h4tp,g8cfx7d,"For those wondering ""double compared to what"", it's compared to hospital-laundered cloth masks. Please nobody misinterpret this to mean the self-laundered masks increased risk compared to no mask. This study didn't test a no-mask group, so it offers no such information in either direction, just relative comparisons between different kinds of masks and laundering methods.

&gt; The risk of infection was more than double among HCW self-washing their masks **compared with the hospital laundry** (HR 2.04 (95% CI 1.03 to 4.00); p=0.04).

When the cloth masks are washed in the hospital laundry, they're roughly as effective as medical masks.

&gt; There was no significant difference in infection between HCW who wore cloth masks washed in the hospital laundry compared with medical masks (p=0.5).

The authors continue to recommend cloth masks where medical masks are unavailable.

&gt; Well-designed cloth masks may provide protection in the community, but design is only one aspect of the safety and effectiveness of a cloth mask. Daily washing as recommended by the WHO is also necessary. **This study shows that a well-washed cloth mask is as protective as a medical mask.**

They don't explicitly say what the hospital laundry conditions were, but they do mention a temperature range.

&gt; Daily washing of cloth masks at the recommended temperature of 60°C–90°C in whatever setting they are used, including the community, is essential for safety.

Residential water heaters are typically set at 60 °C, though many organizations advise colder to prevent burns and save energy. It might make sense for anyone laundering masks at home to turn their water heater up for the duration of the pandemic, as long as they don't have small children or others at risk of burns. Though it's not clear whether the hospital laundry worked better because it washed hotter or with better chemicals, or because it provided better mechanical agitation, or just because it actually washed the masks (since I suspect compliance with self-reported self-washing may be quite bad).

A surgical-style mask seems clearly better than a cloth mask, if only because it's easier to breathe through, roughly as protective (according to this study), and disposable (thus saving the effort of washing it, and the risk of users not washing it properly). Cloth masks machine-laundered at home still seem fine though.",1,t2_6kgmb0p7,2020-10-11 02:04:24,/r/COVID19/comments/j899fz/contamination_and_washing_of_cloth_masks_and_risk/g8cfx7d/,0

Oxford Scientific Brief from July :

[SARS-CoV-2 and the Role of Orofecal Transmission: Evidence Brief](https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/sars-cov-2-orofecal-transmission/) 

There are multiple factors to consider for the possibility of orofecal transmission.  

Live SARS-CoV-2 virus has been observed in stool and urine samples.  What is being observed is everyone infected can test positive faecally, but not everyone infected sheds a viable virus.  

Determining live SARS-CoV-2 can be shed and remains viable - means we should be implementing all the scientific knowledge we already discern of viral orofecal transmission.  The brief alludes to recommendations and knowledge we already have respecting health and safety against viral orofecal transmission. 

There's no specific evidence with this SARS-CoV-2 virus of direct human-to-human transmission via the orofecal route.  Consequently, we're ignoring a large collection of scientific evidence of the similar behaviour of SARS and MERS which do transmit via the orofecal route.

[https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2003/05/sars-virus-can-last-2-days-surfaces-and-feces](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2003/05/sars-virus-can-last-2-days-surfaces-and-feces)

Woeful community sanitation is not the only problem. Woeful personal hygiene can also be a problem. Woeful toilet ventilation can aerosolize the virus.  

We've already connected the dots that SARS-CoV-2 is viable in feces, urine and vomit and the associating flush plumes and vomit plumes (AGMPs) can cause airborne and fomite transmission - same as SARS and MERS.

[Aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMPs) are increasingly being recognized as important sources for nosocomial transmission of emerging viruses.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6518581/)

[We know a virus that can tranmit via the orofecal route can become airborne in toilet ventilation and infect ice cubes causing tranmission via alchol drinks.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6518581/)

Yet, somehow we don't concern ourselves with the health and safety of toilet ventilation on ships, planes, restaurants and buildings.  We continue to rely on oral testing. 

&gt; Policy should emphasise routine surveillance of food, wastewaters and effluent. The importance of strict personal hygiene measures, chlorine-based disinfection of surfaces in locations with presumed or known SARS CoV-2 activity should form part of public policy and education campaigns. Stool testing should be carried out in dischargees from the hospital or other holding facilities well before discharge date and discharge should be conditional either on cessation of fecal excretion or strict quarantine and personal hygiene measures in those still excreting viral particles by stool independently from respiratory excretion. 

Here's the rub; the recommended health and safety measures against the addition of orofecal transmission would actually simplify what we currently have for health and safety recommendations and simplify long-term solutions against other pandemics related to influenza and norovirus.",1,t2_4y3dhut,2020-10-11 02:12:04,/r/COVID19/comments/j7abqv/mild_and_asymptomatic_cases_of_covid19_are/g8ch5ck/,0

I'm incredibly curious about a brit saying this.  I can understand any American's desire to look no further than Twitter.  Our PM has made it clear they don't support the ridiculous conspiracy theory that China is lying about its numbers.  Was Boris in hospital maybe when all the accusations came out?

Yes, China tried to deny COVID existed at the beginning.  Nobody else except the US is today suggesting China is still lying.   

The term you are seeking is ""draconian measures"".  That's how all of the western news and media referred to the successful implementation of strict lockdowns.   Where for 3 weeks nobody could travel outside their province except for Wuhan where nobody could leave their homes.  Barbaric measures were implemented where nurses were sent to homes to test people and everyone testing positive was taken to quarantine facilities - where they conduct barbaric acts such as caring and feeding the sick. 

China opened after three weeks and Wuhan has been open since late April.  When I say open, I mean fully returned to normal.  The only current COVID-19 measures at points of entry.  Mandatory isolation where travellers are subjected to a brutal 28 day stay in a hotel of their choice.  Expect to be fed and cared for at government expense and not be able to leave until tested 3 times negative. 

There are people who are going to reply to this without even reading this far who are going to deny that anyone living in a province other than Wuhan felt nearly any negative effects.  China's economy is only affected in that other countries' economies are affected, they are otherwise full steam ahead.

The reason for China's success?  They followed WHO recommendations to a T - same with New Zealand.  Western media have done exceptionally well at ignoring the success to return to normal for New Zealand.

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j8ryk3,t3_j8ryk3,g8d9zum,"https://www.fairhealth.org/article/costs-for-a-hospital-stay-for-covid-19

According to public health experts, 15 to 20 percent of people who get COVID-19 and seek treatment may need a hospital stay for the disease. In a recent brief, FAIR Health studied what the costs of those hospital stays might be.

FAIR Health estimated the costs based on ICD-10 procedure codes and revenue codes associated with flu and pneumonia (lung inflammation caused by infection). We analyzed data from our database of over 30 billion private healthcare claim records, the largest such repository in the country. We found the average charge per COVID-19 patient requiring a hospital stay to be $73,300. That charge is the estimated cost for a patient with no health insurance. It’s also the cost for a patient seeing an out-of-network provider and whose health plan has no out-of-network benefit.

The average estimated in-network amount per privately insured patient is lower: $38,221. The in-network amount is the amount that the providers in the plan’s network have agreed to accept as full payment. It includes both the amount the plan pays and the amount the patient pays. The amount the patient pays is based on the cost-sharing provisions of the plan.

These numbers are useful to know to help you understand how much the COVID-19 pandemic is costing our country. But it’s also important to know that they’re not the actual amount you’re likely to have to pay if you or someone in your family gets COVID-19. If you have insurance, your costs will be determined by the cost-sharing terms of your health plan. If you don’t have insurance, your costs will vary based on your specific case. And you may be able to negotiate a lower amount with your providers.",1,t2_61496z7j,2020-10-11 04:46:29,/r/COVID19/comments/j8ryk3/average_covid19_hospital_cost_nearly_75000/g8d9zum/,0

Bacteria multiplying in a hand-washed mask would make sense, but viruses raise some questions on what's exactly going on to produce the difference between hand washed and laundry washed.

 The virus would have to survive being washed and being on the mask and, critically, for that to be factor, the nurse would have to not be infected before the mask was washed, even though it would also have to have the virus on it, otherwise the act of washing can't be related.

Maybe bacteria on the mask increases the likelihood of infection, or handwashing damages the mask's protective effects (ignoring source control) compared to laundering, but the actual cleansing and removal of viruses from the mask doesn't seem like it could be a factor that explains the difference.

The only thing I can think of is an increased risk in contamination of a clean mask by hands when it's removed before its washed.

I don't understand why is so hard to believe for so many western people the success of China (and some other nations that took the issue seriously from the very beginning and not after it was already too like, like South Korea, Taiwan or New Zealand), when from the beginning China took extreme measures to control the virus. They didn't wait for it to spread, they didn't allow people to leave their houses from the very beginning, they taught their population how to avoid getting sick by washing their hands, asking them to open their windows open, measuring every single person's temperature... they even made public where people who tested positive live. With all those measures, how could they possibly get more cases than those? I am sure it was not comfortable to live under such strict restrictions, but ironically, they are more free than most of the world is now.

I updated my post with the links to the WHO recommendations at the beginning of the pandemic where they specifically state - 14 day quarantine.  

What should not be confused about the WHO travel recommendations is this, the WHO does no recommend border closure.  So, what Canada and US have done to deny their citizens travelling between Canada and the US since March, is not recommended.  

The WHO clarifies; borders can remain open as long as points of entry can test, isolate, treat and quarantine with no exceptions.

[https://www.who.int/news-room/articles-detail/public-health-considerations-while-resuming-international-travel](https://www.who.int/news-room/articles-detail/public-health-considerations-while-resuming-international-travel)

This has always been the WHO position. 

Canada and the US are also two of the very few countries worldwide who do not offer mandatory quarantine for those who are sick.  Instead, those who are infected are advised to fend for themselves at home. 

Why?  Guess they don't want to inconvenience the economy and prefer to piss away trillions propping it up while allowing the virus to enter via international flights.

Huh?  On April 17th, China adjusted the number deaths from 3,342 up to 4,632 to account for excess mortality due to unconfirmed cases.  It's probably less than 5,000 total. 

The reason the UK has 5x as many cases (100x per capita) and 10x as many deaths (200x per capita) is because the UK response has been woeful compared to China.  China eradicated the disease by March, with basically ZERO cases since then.  The UK did not.

""Covid-19 and healthcare infrastructure in Turkey""

&gt; Another point where Turkey differs from other countries is its unrestricted and unregulated use of untested medicines in Covid-19 treatment. According to a manual published by the Ministry of Health, doctors are free to begin prescribing medicine for Covid-19 treatment after they have made their clinical diagnosis, even without waiting for the results of the PCR test. In the first stage of the treatment, the medicine Hydroxychloroquine is used. If no progress is seen, then patients are given antiviral medicine Favipiravir, which is used for the treatment of influenza in Japan.

&gt; Turkey’s minister of health underlines that this standard treatment approach is unique to Turkey: ‘No other country used the drug Hydroxychloroquine in the initial treatment of all suspected and positive cases [of Covid-19]. We stocked one million boxes of the drug before we even had our first case. Also, no other country uses the drug Favipiravir, which is imported from China, in the way we use it’.",2,t2_4v3cw,2020-10-11 08:39:00,/r/COVID19/comments/j8o9lr/favipiravir_at_high_doses_has_potent_antiviral/g8ehlq9/,0

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j6unvo,t1_g81avuj,g8eo32g,"Wrt covid policy, I hope that we can agree on the following principles:

- Every decision has tradeoffs.

- COVID policy is not easy, and a wide spectrum of positions can be adopted in good faith. 

I'm certain about the policy-relevant science of COVID spread - the IFR, the hospitalization rate, waning of protective immunity, and low K. 

I'm way, wayyyy less certain about what government should do to help people. Should we focus all our testing on at-risk groups and settings and stop trying to prevent all spread? I don't know. Should we crush the virus with a sharp and short lockdown before returning to normal? I don't know. Should we mask up and cluster bust? (I don't know, though Japan makes me very bullish).

I guess my point is that I think there are a range of acceptable policies. But I strongly oppose a policy that treats infection in the young as a positive good. I think there are incredibly fraught situations once that happens - eg where young people try to get infected - or where companies get government encouragement to require their employees to expose themselves to risks they'd rather avoid.

And I wish these guys were even attempting to engage with the broader scientific community.

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j810jx,t1_g8atcu1,g8f66o7,"Studies have been relatively consistent on this topic, except for a study published early on commonly known as *[Long et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32555424/)* I don't know of any other study other than *Long* which showed rapid decline.

[This study](https://immunology.sciencemag.org/content/5/52/eabe5511.full) also showing robust, persistent adaptive immune responses addresses the disparity between theirs and *Long*'s results directly:

&gt; Our findings that the IgG response to SARS-CoV-2 antigens is stable over a 3-month period are consistent with other studies who likewise noted durability in the IgG response to the spike trimer (8–13). These data and ours contrast with those of Long et al., who showed rapid decay of antibody levels when profiling the response to a linear peptide motif of the C-terminal part of the spike protein (14) instead of the spike trimer used here, and it is possible that the antigen selection accounts for some of the differences. However, this does not explain discrepant results with respect to the anti-NP response in the serum, which we find also largely persisted over the 3-month period. One potential difference that could explain these divergent results is that we employed a sensitive and robust chemiluminescence plate-based ELISA whereas Long et al. employed magnetic chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay kits with immobilized recombinant or peptide antigens.

There have been population studies which showed declining seroprevalence but that usually comes down to the type of assay used and the specific epitope they look for also. For instance [this study from Ontario](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.28.20200915v2) that shows drastically different prevalence and sensitivity when using a nucleocapsid assay versus a spike assay.",1,t2_593zf,2020-10-11 11:04:57,/r/COVID19/comments/j810jx/sarscov2_elicits_robust_adaptive_immune_responses/g8f66o7/,0

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j7irwc,t1_g88rrlj,g8fajek,"&gt;From the beginning of the whole mask debate, it always seemed pretty straightforward that a barrier in front of the mouth and nose is unlikely to potentiate the ingress and egress of droplets, or rather it would require a very extraordinary explanation for that to have been the case.

The barrier's capability to influence the ingress and egress of droplets was, in my opinion, not a topic of debate among the serious EBM practitioners critical of the mask mandates. 

Droplet ingress and egress are just a part of a very complex chain of infection. For the droplets to matter, the individuals need to be in close proximity and/or in poorly ventilated environments for extended periods of time. The presence of these individuals are influenced by the behavioral aspects of wearing masks.

These are hardly extraordinary explanations:

1) Because of the masks mandates, individuals may feel safe enough to enter an indoor space rather than using curbside pickup or delivery services.

2) Because of the mask mandates, individuals with very mild symptoms may be willing to go out into the community to work or do essential tasks.

3) People may use the mask incorrectly, sometimes in very [unexpected](https://www.kwqc.com/content/news/Why-you-should-Tip-Your-Mask--569907021.html) ways. 

As long as masks are not perfect barriers, the effect of these potential harms have to be weighted against the benefits. Absence of evidence for these harms are not evidence of their absence.",1,t2_xyfln,2020-10-11 11:30:14,/r/COVID19/comments/j7irwc/face_masks_what_the_data_say/g8fajek/,0

Imperial College London's Professor Darrel Francis (@profdfrancis, specialty is cardiology) has some excellent twitter threads on these types of topics from the time of the myocarditis papers in August (the ones that shut down Big 10 football). Ultimately without pre-COVID scans/MRIs/etc., you have no idea if what you're seeing is the result of COVID or the result of pre-existing phenomena caused by lifestyle factors (age, diet, exercise habits or lack thereof, smoking, drinking, etc.). Beyond that, we haven't really hit 'long term' in the true sense of the word - it takes a lot longer to recover from severe viral illnesses than people often expect, and it doesn't surprise me that there's a subset of people who are taking longer to recover from a mild or moderate viral infection to which the immune system is totally naive. It's also very likely that if we went hunting for sequelae after more common viral illnesses on the scale that we're hunting for them after SARS-CoV-2 infection, we'd find it.

&gt;  
&gt;As the world faces COVID-19, the search for effective treatments against the disease and its complications has turned its gaze to drugs that are classically used in other infectious diseases. Some drugs are being examined for the recent evidence on its effects on viral replication and inflammation.   
&gt;  
&gt;The aim of the study was to assess the outcome of Ivermectin-Azithromycin-Cholecalciferol combination therapy on early stages (I-IIa) of COVID-19 patients. This proof of concept study was carried out on confirmed COVID-19 patients in Mexico City, from April 01 to April 20, 2020.   
&gt;  
&gt;Patients who met inclusion criteria were invited to take Ivermectin (6 mg once daily in day 0,1,7 and 8) plus Azithromycin (500 mg once daily for 4 days) plus Cholecalciferol (4000 UI twice daily for 30 days).   
&gt;  
&gt;Treatment outcome was evaluated on the 10th day onward from the first day of the drug intake. Recovery rate of the 28 patients that received the combination therapy was 100%, the mean symptomatic recovery duration was 3.6 days and negative PCR was confirmed on day 10. Imaging findings of patients with pneumonia were improved on day 10. Transient and mild degree of adverse effect like diarrhea and nausea was noted by 3 (10.7%) patients.   
&gt;  
&gt;This study found that the combination treatment might mitigate disease progression without significant adverse effects. Further studies are needed in order to extrapolate these findings to moderate and severe COVID-19.",2,t2_1g543a,2020-10-11 17:46:38,/r/COVID19/comments/j8zko6/effects_of_ivermectin_azithromycin_and/g8gmz6d/,0

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j6unvo,t1_g8eo32g,g8guf0v,"&gt;I guess my point is that I think there are a range of acceptable policies.

No, I really don't think there is, and there aren't nearly enough for western societies who are founded on principles of democracy and freedom. So I think you haven't really convinced me here by demonstrating any viable alternatives. Meanwhile, we have policies, or rather I say experiments with no scientific basis advocated by the WHO, which are crushing livelihoods and our children's future.

Firstly, let's start with communication.

There are 3 extremely unhelpful methods of trying to communicate or persuade people:

1. Promoting and stoking fear
2. Telling people what they want to hear
3. Shaming and vilifying those who have opposing viewpoints

We see this compounded by the fact of people speaking outside their field and given a platform to do more of it to a wider part of the population. Often critiquing any opposing viewpoint without proposing any other viable alternative.

Moreover,  even if it were proven that lockdowns are our only way around this, understanding the unmet needs and providing resources to address them should be the guiding principle of COVID19 response.

Want people to stay at home? Sure--make sure the families are fed and not going to be evicted.  Want people to test? Sure--align testing strategies with their needs or make sure they get paid time off.  Want them to isolate? Sure--make sure that they have a comfortable and safe space to isolate.",1,t2_1yi5wmyb,2020-10-11 18:45:15,/r/COVID19/comments/j6unvo/covid19_group_of_uk_and_us_experts_argues_for/g8guf0v/,0

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j936tt,t3_j936tt,g8gulqq,"&gt; As of October 2020, there are &gt;1 million documented deaths with  COVID‐19. Excess deaths can be caused by both COVID‐19 and the measures  taken. COVID‐19 shows extremely strong risk stratification across age,  socioeconomic factors, and clinical factors. Calculation of  years‐of‐life‐lost from COVID‐19 is methodologically challenging that  can yield misleading over‐estimates. Many early deaths may have been due  to suboptimal management, malfunctional health systems,  hydroxychloroquine, sending COVID‐19 patients to nursing homes, and  nosocomial infections; such deaths are partially avoidable moving  forward. About 10% of the global population may be infected by October  2020. Global infection fatality rate is 0.15‐0.20% (0.03‐0.04% in those  &lt;70 years), with large variability across locations with different  age‐structure, institutionalization rates, socioeconomic inequalities,  population‐level clinical risk profile, public health measures, and  health care. There is debate on whether at least 60% of the global  population must be infected for herd immunity, or, conversely, mixing  heterogeneity and pre‐existing cross‐immunity may allow substantially  lower thresholds. Simulations are presented with a total of 1.58‐8.76  million COVID‐19 deaths over 5‐years (1/2000‐12/2024) globally (0.5‐2.9%  of total global deaths). The most favorable figures in that range would  be feasible if high risk groups can be preferentially protected with  lower infection rates than the remaining population. Death toll may also  be further affected by potential availability of effective vaccines and  treatments, optimal management and measures taken, COVID‐19 interplay  with influenza and other health problems, reinfection potential, and any  chronic COVID‐19 consequences. Targeted, precise management of the  pandemic and avoiding past mistakes would help minimize mortality.",1,t2_7fu8zkt,2020-10-11 18:46:50,/r/COVID19/comments/j936tt/global_perspective_of_covid19_epidemiology_for_a/g8gulqq/,0

[Some](https://old.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/hbic8s/how_deadly_is_the_coronavirus_scientists_are/fvp268z/?context=3) of my [thoughts](https://old.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/hpp0mf/covid19_pandemic_planning_scenarios/fxuav8y/?context=3):

&gt;Posted this in a since-deleted post. Here are my incomplete thoughts on the update (and why I think people should not trust Ioannidis on this subject):

&gt;This updated version was [already discussed](https://old.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/h7f6qx/the_infection_fatality_rate_of_covid19_inferred/).

&gt;Honestly, I no longer believe that Ioannidis is operating in good faith. This is riddled with basic errors tending to support his priors, including undercounting the number of deaths in the relevant districts in Hesse, giving an IFR from the Brazil study of 0.3% when the authors of that study report 1%, and taking the cluster-sample 25% prevalence from Oise instead of the blood donor sample 3% prevalence. In two cases, the authors of a serosurvey he cites estimate an IFR themselves; his estimate is always substantially lower. More than half of these are convenience samples, at least one of which was a targeted sample of people who had been exposed. For two of these surveys, the measured prevalence is lower than the expected number of false positives; he does not adjust for specificity or sensitivity.

&gt;At this point, he's wasting everyone's time trying to save face - people with subject matter expertise have had to spend hours looking through the serosurveys he cites to figure out how badly he has constructed this paper to support his priors. This entire enterprise has wasted valuable time and has misinformed a substantial subset of the public about the risks of COVID-19.

&gt;I feel badly about the reputational harm that has and will continue to accrue here. But quality of the science itself and the impact that it has had on the broader discourse is bad enough to warrant it.

--------------

&gt;As for your point about what happens at the end - it may very well be that there's a low IFR. That's not the point here - it's the evidence available at the time and the arguments used to justify it. On those counts, Ioannidis has no leg to stand on here. The best evidence is still shaky, but the best evidence does not support his position. And it isn't really a difference in judgment - he makes material basic-level mistakes in favor of his priors in a way that isn't scientific at all.

In light of the ons seroprevalence survey and others, I would no longer characterize the evidence as shaky - even the age-stratified situation is pretty clear and getting clearer.",1,t2_lp01t,2020-10-12 00:31:57,/r/COVID19/comments/j936tt/global_perspective_of_covid19_epidemiology_for_a/g8i0b0x/,0

This is actually understandable given that this hardly a situation where people will be conducting controlled experiments and most of the recommendations will have to be inferred rather than demonstrated. 

Some of the practices mentioned in this article strike me as either 'odd' or contradictory. ""Cover your face when coughing or sneezing"" is definitely a good idea, but it clashes with ""don't touch your face"". Maybe another recommendation mentioned ie to carry a cloth or such to cough or sneeze into is a happy compromise though it has to be noted that the hands that use the cloth are automatically 'contaminated'. I've actually never heard the ""close the toilet seat before flushing"" idea before. It's fine, I guess, assuming there is a significant viral load passed during defecation. Urination ? I doubt it. But then does reducing the number of droplets launched during a toilet flush *really* outweigh the risks of multiple hands touching the seat ? Maybe th idea is to walk to a hand sanitizer station in the bathroom, do the routine and then go back to close and flush. Somehow I doubt that this is a major mode of transmission.

&gt;  
&gt;**Background:** Biomarkers to predict Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) outcome early at infection are urgently needed to improve prognosis and treatment. Zinc balances immune responses and also has a proven direct antiviral action against some viruses. Importantly, zinc deficiency (ZD) is a common condition in elderly and individuals with chronic diseases, two groups with more severe COVID-19 outcomes. We hypothesize that serum zinc content (SZC) influences COVID-19 disease progression and thus might represent a useful biomarker.   
&gt;  
&gt;**Methods:** We run a retrospective observational study with 249 COVID-19 patients admitted in Hospital del Mar. We have studied COVID-19 severity and progression attending to SZC at admission. In parallel we have studied SARS-CoV2 replication in the Vero E6 cell line modifying zinc concentrations.   
&gt;  
&gt;**Findings:** Our study demonstrates a correlation between serum zinc levels and COVID-19 outcome. Serum zinc levels lower than 50 mcgg/dl at admission correlated with worse clinical presentation, longer time to reach stability and higher mortality. Our in vitro results indicate that low zinc levels favor viral expansion in SARS-CoV2 infected cells.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Interpretation:** SZC is a novel biomarker to predict COVID-19 outcome. We encourage performing randomized clinical trials to study zinc supplementation as potential prophylaxis and treatment with people at risk of zinc deficiency.",1,t2_1g543a,2020-10-12 02:05:08,/r/COVID19/comments/j98y7f/low_zinc_levels_at_clinical_admission_associates/g8iaxao/,0

Understanding SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence as a marker of prior infection in a spectrum of healthcare workers (HCWs) may guide risk stratification and enactment of better health policies and procedures. 

The present study reported on cross-sectional study to determine the prevalence and longevity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in HCWs at a regional hospital system in Orange County, California, between May and August, 2020. 

Data from HCWs (n=3,458) were included in the analysis. Data from first responders (n=226) were also analyzed for comparison. A blood sample was collected at study enrollment and 8-week follow-up. Information on job duties, location, COVID-19 symptoms, polymerase chain reaction test history, travel since January 2020, and household contacts with COVID-19 was collected. Comparisons to estimated community prevalence were also evaluated. 

Observed antibody prevalence was 0.93% and 2.58% at initial and 8-week follow-up, respectively, for HCWs, and 5.31% and 4.35% for first responders. For HCWs, significant differences (p &lt; .05) between negative vs. positive at initial assessment were found for age, race, fever, and loss of smell, and at 8-week follow-up for age, race, and all symptoms. Antibody positivity persisted at least 8 weeks in this cohort. Among 75 HCWs with self-reported prior PCR-confirmed COVID-19, 35 (46.7%) were antibody negative. Significant differences between negative vs. positive were observed in age and frequency of symptoms. 

This study found considerably lower SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence among HCWs compared with prior published studies. This may be explained by better safety measures in the workplace, heightened awareness inside and outside of the workplace, possibly lower susceptibility due to innate immunity and other biological heterogeneity, and low COVID-19 prevalence in the community itself. HCWs with initial positive results had persistent positive serologies at 8 weeks. Further research is warranted to investigate factors influencing such lower prevalence in our HCWs.",1,t2_blqmw,2020-10-12 02:24:39,/r/COVID19/comments/j9ajea/prevalence_and_longevity_of_sarscov2_antibodies/g8id6kp/,0

**Introduction**

The impact of school opening on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is still unknown. This study aims to provide preliminary information about the number of SARS-CoV-2 cases among students attending Italian schools. 

**Methods**

Data are extracted and analysed from an open access, online dataset that monitor, on a daily basis, media news about SARS-CoV-2 infections of students attending Italian schools.

**Results**

As of 5 October 2020, a total of 1350 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections have been registered in the Italian territory schools (involving 1059 students, 145 teachers and 146 other school members), for a total of 1212 out of 65104 (1.8%) Italian schools involved. National schools reported only 1 case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in more than 90% of cases, and only in one high school a cluster of more than 10 cases have been described (P 0.015). The detection of one or more SARS-CoV-2 infections leaded to the closure of 192 (14.2%) entire schools, more frequently nursery/kindergartens (P &lt;0.0005). 

**Discussion**

COVID-19 is a respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and declared by the World Health Organization as a global public health emergency. 

Among the severe outbreaks across South America, Uruguay has become known for curtailing SARS-CoV-2 exceptionally well. To understand the SARS-CoV-2 introductions, local transmissions, and associations with genomic and clinical parameters in Uruguay, we sequenced the viral genomes of 44 outpatients and inpatients in a private healthcare system in its capital, Montevideo, from March to May 2020. We performed a phylogeographic analysis using sequences from our cohort and other studies that indicate a minimum of 23 independent introductions into Uruguay, resulting in five major transmission clusters. 

Our data suggest that most introductions resulting in chains of transmission originate from other South American countries, with the earliest seeding of the virus in late February 2020, weeks before the borders were closed to all non-citizens and a partial lockdown implemented. Genetic analyses suggest a dominance of S and G clades (G, GH, GR) that make up &gt;90% of the viral strains in our study. In our cohort, lethal outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly correlated with arterial hypertension, kidney failure, and ICU admission (FDR &lt; 0.01), but not with any mutation in a structural or non-structural protein, such as the spike D614G mutation. Our study contributes genetic, phylodynamic, and clinical correlation data about the exceptionally well-curbed SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Uruguay, which furthers the understanding of disease patterns and regional aspects of the pandemic in Latin America.",1,t2_blqmw,2020-10-12 02:29:08,/r/COVID19/comments/j9alro/sarscov2_genomic_characterization_and_clinical/g8idpdu/,0

Wastewater-based monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 holds promise as tool to inform public health-decision making. Testing at individual building-level could be an efficient, passive means of preventing early detection of new cases in congregate living settings, but this approach has not been validated. Sample collection protocols were developed and refined during preliminary sampling from a hospital and a local municipal wastewater treatment plant. Molecular diagnostic methods were compared side-by-side to assess feasibility, performance and sensitivity. Optimized sample collection and processing protocols were then used to monitor two occupied dormitory complexes (n=105 and 66) over eight weeks. Wastewater results were validated using known case counts from external clinical testing of building occupants. 

Results confirm that ultracentrifugation from a 24 hour composite collection had a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 100%. However, if the detection of convalescent shedding is considered a false positive then the sensitivity would be 95.2% but the specificity would drop to 52%. We determined a highly sensitive method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 shedding in building wastewater however our methods could not distinguish new infectious cases from persistent convalescent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Future work must focus on methods to distinguish new infections from convalescent shedding to widely deploy this promising wastewater surveillance tool.",1,t2_blqmw,2020-10-12 02:33:21,/r/COVID19/comments/j9aozz/development_of_wastewater_pooled_surveillance_of/g8ie7c3/,0

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j98y7f,t1_g8idfvh,g8ifnph,"Let us start by looking at cost-benefit of testing asymptomatic people (general or contact tracing):

    Lspt = lives saved per test
    Pp = proportion positive
    Pt = proportion of positives that transmit to at least one other person (only ~ 10% transmit, but a few are superspreaders)
    Nt = Avg number of new positives per transmission event
    Pd = proportion of cases that die
    
    Lspt = Pp x Pt x Nt x Pd
    NNT = 1/Lspt

I get:

    Lspt = 0.01 x 0.1 x 10 x .001 = 0.00001
    NNT = 100,000

Then +/- an order of magnitude gives a range for NNT of 10,000 to 1,000,000. Then lets correct for transmission chains. The probability a chain continues for Nc rounds of infections from the first is:

    (1 – (1 – Pt)^Nt)^Nc

Plugging in my values above gets .42 for Nc = 2. Ie, on average the chain will break after ~2 rounds (20 total infections stemming from the one detected) and has only ~ 1% of making it to ten rounds (100 total infections)

So, then NNT is between 5,000 and 500,000. If each test requires 5 minutes of ""man hours"" at $25 dollars/hr then that is 400-40,000 manhours per life saved at a cost of $10,000-$1,000,000. Then the tests (+ labwork) themselves cost ~$50 so add in $250,000 - $25,000,000. 

So I get a final range of $260,000 to $26,000,000 dollars spent on testing per life saved. Those resources can be used much more intelligently to save many more lives. The mass testing is then effectively killing people missing out on superior medical interventions the resources would have been devoted to.

Plug in your own values and see how low you can get the NNT while keeping it plausible.",1,t2_3o3skn71,2020-10-12 02:45:48,/r/COVID19/comments/j98y7f/low_zinc_levels_at_clinical_admission_associates/g8ifnph/,0

I don't think that significantly changes the overall policy action, though. A small number of people with legitimate medical exemptions won't change the epidemic curve much, and exemptions can be issued in the same way e.g. as exemptions from mandatory vaccination in public schools (which itself is not without controversy, of course). Many companies are issuing masks with transparent centers to the colleagues of hearing-impaired workers. Hearing-impaired people do lose the ability to lip-read with strangers; but netting such definite but minor (though non-negligible) inconveniences against our best guess at the uncertain saving in coronavirus deaths and suffering, it still seems like a good bet to me.

I've seen some papers on the psychological effects of mask use (e.g., [An empirical and theoretical investigation into the psychological effects of wearing a mask
](https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/43402/) and some of its references), and I wasn't too impressed. They seemed straight from the Freudian storytelling tradition, not too close to anything modern psychology would consider evidence. I'd like but haven't found a psychological study of a factory, health care facility, or other organization where similar pools of workers perform different jobs, some requiring masks and some not; perhaps there'd even be one with sufficient scheduling flexibility to randomize. Anecdotally from my own experience (lab and factory), nobody noticed any adverse psychological effects, nor from the longstanding practice in East Asia of wearing a mask in public when you're sick.

I also wish more attention had been paid to mask wearer comfort. I've tried some of the handmade masks sewn (according to government advice) from many layers of finely-woven fabric, and they're genuinely near-impossible to breathe through. Surgical-style masks with a layer of meltblown fabric are far more comfortable, and widely available near pre-pandemic prices. Likewise, I'm a healthy adult and would still find it quite stressful to wear a properly-fitted N95 all day. I wonder how much opposition to masks comes from people who tried an uncomfortable mask and are genuinely unaware that better options exist.",1,t2_6kgmb0p7,2020-10-12 03:08:15,/r/COVID19/comments/j7irwc/face_masks_what_the_data_say/g8iitbo/,0

Maybe this is a little more of an open-ended question, but I'm interested in what the scientists here think of that tool. In particular:

\- Is the overall methodology (multiplying together a bunch of risk ratios from a bunch of different studies) sound?

\- Is it likely that this type of model could be useful e.g. for the general public to make decisions, or for localities to decide what to open back up and when?

\- How does this methodology compare to more traditional epidemiological models? Do epidemiologists normally make very granular models like this?

\- In particular, it seems like it would be very useful for policymakers to be able to answer questions like ""by what amount will the Rt go up if we allow indoor dining?"" Do we normally have models that can answer this type of question? Would something like the microcovid model be useful for this?

Nobody has ever run a study that randomized teenagers to smoke or not for the next fifty years and then checked back to see who got cancer.

That's not a perfect analogy for our mask situation, since the individual decisions of millions of people to smoke or not make a spurious correlation less likely than with the smaller number of observational data points we have to judge mask effectiveness. It would also be cheaper to run a properly-powered RCT for the masks (but still very expensive, especially if you want to test the two-sided benefit of both wearer protection and source control, which is presumably why nobody has done so yet). It's in the same general direction though, just with much weaker evidence for the masks.

Taking this to an absurd extreme, my neighbor and I--neither of whom ever smoked--could randomize ourselves to smoking and non-smoking groups (of one person each), and then check back a year later to see if either of us got lung cancer. We would then consider the null hypothesis that smoking doesn't cause cancer, and the alternative hypothesis that it does. We would analyze the data to determine whether we could reject the null hypothesis to p &lt; 5%, and we'd find that we couldn't (even if the smoker got cancer and the non-smoker didn't!). Our RCT would therefore find no evidence that smoking causes cancer.

So would this convince you to disregard the observational evidence that smoking causes cancer, in favor of my new, higher-quality RCT evidence that it doesn't? Maybe if I enrolled a few hundred participants, and ran the study for five years? If you (correctly) think my examples are ridiculous, then you shouldn't accept RCT results--especially negative results--without carefully considering the statistical power of the studies.

China has had roughly a half dozen ""community"" cases in the past 7 months, but they were detected quickly, with regional isolation, mass testing, isolation, etc. fast enough to prevent widespread growth.  The real turning point was when the Chinese found out that it was possible and feasible to do comprehensive PCR testing of an entire city of 10 million people within a week.  Once they proved that it was possible in the second Wuhan outbreak, they were able to pre-emptively identify and isolate the asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic and paucisymptomatic cases *before* they spread to others.  It's a huge game-changer, in the same way that imposition of isolation quarantine of infected people works to prevent accidental secondary spread within households or to medical staff.  As a result, China can tamp down an outbreak when it's in the single/double-digits, before it explodes into 100s, 1000s or more. The most recent was about 2 months ago, and they did the whole thing over just TWO (2) cases. They're really thorough, and the results are self-evident. 

I believe China can maintain zero domestic transmission pretty much indefinitely, and I think the ongoing national holiday is going to validate it.  Or rather, I don't think the Chinese national leadership would have literally opened up *everything* just to see the entire country get infected.

SARS-CoV-2  has intricate mechanisms for initiating infection, immune  evasion/suppression, and replication, which depend on the structure and  dynamics of its constituent proteins. Many protein structures have been  solved, but far less is known about their relevant conformational  changes. To address this challenge, over a million citizen scientists  banded together through the Folding@home distributed computing project  to create the first exascale computer and simulate an unprecedented 0.1  seconds of the viral proteome. Our simulations capture dramatic opening  of the apo Spike complex, far beyond that seen experimentally, which  explains and successfully predicts the existence of ""cryptic"" epitopes.  Different Spike homologues modulate the probabilities of open versus  closed structures, balancing receptor binding and immune evasion. We  also observe dramatic conformational changes across the proteome, which  reveal over 50 ""cryptic"" pockets that expand targeting options for the  design of antivirals. All data and models are freely available online,  providing a quantitative structural atlas.",2,t2_rpjo0,2020-10-12 04:43:14,/r/COVID19/comments/j9d3ti/sarscov2_simulations_go_exascale_to_capture_spike/g8iwdrg/,0

None of these people appear to have any background in infectious disease or...science?...so that's an issue. For example, they're assigning country (or state)-level risk to finite areas - that's not really that useful. The risk to someone engaging in any activity in the southeast of the UK is far less than someone in the northwest of the UK, just as an example. They're using a 6x multiplier for cases if the positive rate is &lt;5%, 8x if it's between 5-15%, and 10x if it's greater than 15% - that's not transparent unless you're reading the methods. The methods are...long and I'll be honest, I can't pick them apart because there's so much stuff contained in footnotes on other pages. I also fundamentally dislike the way that this paints people (whether justified by risk or not) who cannot WFH/get grocery delivery/get everything delivered like a filthy plague rat. From a public health perspective, that's actually a huge part of the problem - the pandemic is foisted upon those that can least afford to get sick (lack of sick pay, unstable incomes, public facing jobs, etc.) because those who can shelter are doing so.  

But beyond that, they are basing all of this on their own personal assessment of risk - they want to ""aim to keep each of our individual risks of getting COVID below 1% per year,"" which is probably more conservative than the average bear - what if you're okay with 2%, 5%, 10%? That's not transparent in their 'omg this is highly dangerous and you can't do anything for 70 weeks' language - it's also not clear if they use their communal 3k out of house/week microcovid budget (mentioned in a random footnote) in that language either. It's also much clearer to people if you use 1 in 50 or 1 in 500 or 1 in 1000 or 1 in 10, IMO, versus this 'microcovid' shit.",2,t2_gh14o,2020-10-12 05:50:53,/r/COVID19/comments/j5juhf/weekly_question_thread_week_of_october_05/g8j5eny/,0

Even if you use the forearm or humerus you have to place the block *directly below* the nose, *not* over it. If you put the arm directly in front of the nose it seems useless. The path of the sneeze is downwards where the arm doesn't block at all. Wearing a mask is much more effective in both cases. The arm block has always seemed to me to be one of the least useful recommendations. Try it and see what I mean, You'd have to have the world's fattest arms for the suggestion to work, as in rolls of flab hanging down from them. Muscle just won't cut it. The pathway to the air is still wide open no matter how big your biceps are. It's that or squish your nose right flat.

High levels of zinc, free zinc ions and low levels of carnosine (due to high levels of carnosinase, the enzyme that degrades carnosine), which is a zinc chelator, cause anosmia and in the latter case are associated with persistent long term anosmia.

If the issue is increased by high body zinc availability, and the fatality rate is generally inversely correlated with zinc, then the anosmia could be an artefact of high zinc status.

Mass infection events are extremely common. In some places, most cases trace to mass infection events (see the Korean studies, the southern US studies). The only reason they've become less common is that mass indoor gatherings are forbidden almost globally.

Masks provide probabilistic protection. They interrupt the flow of respiration.

I agree that it's quite possible that later evidence will show the masks don't work, or that the benefit isn't worth the cost. I'm just saying that masks seem like a good bet to me (i.e., that the probability that they work times the benefit if they do seems like more than the cost of wearing them) now. That's a judgment not only on the probability that they work, but also on the cost and benefit. For example, that expected value seems favorable to me in most developed countries, but probably not in Africa--the cost to purchase the masks would be non-negligible there, and their young age pyramid makes the benefit in averted mortality much smaller. It might have been favorable in Sweden originally, but it's probably not now given their low continuing mortality.

We use a sample of the IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters claims database, which includes claims from 18 million people enrolled in large employer plans in 2018. Specifically, we look at the costs of admissions for people with pneumonia, including three diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) for pneumonia without complications or comorbidity, with complications or comorbidity, and with major complications or comorbidity. These DRGs include pneumonia caused by similar (SARS-associated) coronavirus, as well as other viruses and bacteria. We also looked at two DRGs for respiratory system diagnoses requiring ventilator support. DRGs are groups of similar diagnoses for which the same level of hospital resources are generally required. (It is important to note that at this time, there are no curative treatments for the new coronavirus infection itself; rather, treatment addresses the complications from COVID-19-related illnesses). The sample is limited to people under age 65.


For pneumonia cases with 2-3 days hospitalization, the total cost of treatment, paid for by a combination of the employer plan and the employee’s out-of-pocket costs, we find that the average cost of an admission for pneumonia with major complications and comorbidities is $20,292 in 2018. However, costs vary greatly across the country, with admissions for pneumonia with major complications or comorbidities ranging from $11,533 (25th percentile) to $24,178 (75th percentile).",1,t2_61496z7j,2020-10-12 08:34:21,/r/COVID19/comments/j9g9sd/potential_costs_of_covid19_treatment_for_people/g8jn675/,0

And IFR is ~ 1%: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/new-zealand/

If the other two parameters are the same those two will about cancel out and NNT is still about 100,000 people tested to save one life. Since theyve done 700k tests then they spent $35,000,000 to save about 7 lives  or $5 million each. The question is if that $5 million would save more lives overall if focused on people who are actually ill (from anything, not just covid).

The equations are good (afaict, Im glad to see other approaches or mistakes pointed out) but you could argue for higher Pt and Nt if you want. 

If you want to use hospitalization, etc as the outcome thats fine but will probably be only a factor of ten different. Im also ignoring costs of people stressed out waiting for the test, missing work, being injured by the swab, etc too. 

But sure, I chose death as the best measured outcome. Keep in mind eventually this number should be compared to alternative uses of the resources so those benefits will rise too by changing the outcome.

Eg, I think the same money spent on identifying and treating vitamin/mineral deficiencies would probably have a more reasonable NNT.

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j99dzl,t1_g8jw6be,g8kipzq,"I've been following the pandemic via the [Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) since the beginning and sometimes calculating CFRs. Because I have written these down in a notebook the old numbers aren't hopelessly lost (except to the tracking institution involved). There are two ways to calculate CFR. The first method is to simply divide the deaths by the total number of cases. The second is to divide the deaths by the sum of deaths and 'recovered' ie the total of cases where the outcome is known. When a pandemic/epidemic is finally over and done with the two numbers should be equal as then all cases are either dead or recovered.  Here are a few snapshots in time for the world and the USA from March to October 11. Method 1 is listed first, followed by method 2. *Be aware !!!!* that the quality of reporting varies from country to country. In at least one case, Russia, the case numbers may be fairly accurate, but the number of deaths has been - deliberately - undercounted. The way this has been done is a subject of comment in Russia itself. The most reliable numbers are from developed countries with universal free Medicare. This includes western Europe, Canada, some countries in east Asia, Australia and New Zealand. It excludes the USA where both cases and deaths are undercounted to a greater degree. Here goes (numbers in percentages):

March 19 World 4.8/9.8 -- USA 1.7/1.7

March 29 World4.7/18.0 -- USA 1.8/56.7 (!!!)

April 14 World 5.3/15.4 -- USA 2.6/41.9 (!!!)

June 18 World 5.4/9.9 -- USA 5.4/16.6

August 2 World 3.8/6.1 -- USA 3.3/9.5

September 15 World 3.2/4.5 -- USA 3.3/7.3

October 11 World 2.7/4.0 -- USA 2.8/6.5

I have excluded the European countries but the pattern there is similar and I have those in my notes as well. There is indeed a welcome decrease in CFR by whatever method used. Then we come to the reason why. It may be because of what you have suggested. Most of the reports I have read, however, suggest a different explanation. They ascribe this to better, more effective, medical care of hospitalized patients. This may also be true even though the phrase, ""don't pat yourself on the back too hard; you might break an arm"" comes to mind. 

I am very agnostic about any explanations. The objection I would raise to what you suggested is that 'infective dose' will be much more mirrored in positive cases than in fatality rates. Once a disease gets going it gets going good and proper however many enemies invaded at the beginning and whether you will die or not is much more dependent on other factors. For instance in the early days there was discussion about why Italy had such a comparatively high death rate. The consensus came to be that this was because it had so many more older people than other European countries. 

There is one thing that raises a question in my mind. Is the decline in mortality rates *truly* due to something that people have done, medically or otherwise ? Is it perhaps also (or more ?) indicative of the natural course of an infectious disease. At the onset it is the weakest or the most susceptible (or in this case also the most careless or bullheaded- active non-prevention) who die in higher numbers. As the epidemic/pandemic goes on the number of 'lucky hits' (from a viral point of view) declines and the number of healthier cases who don't die increases. I'm sure the various public health measures have had *some* effect, but how much of an effect compared to the natural course - that I am very unsure of. That, however, is a matter for debate amongst historians of medicine writing well after the problem has passed and all the numbers are in. 

One other thing in the Johns Hopkins site piqued my interest. As you go through each country there is a graph on the lower right that gives the daily reported cases. The shapes of the curves vary from nation to nation. When I look at European countries most seem to follow the 'second wave' pattern that you mentioned. In the case of some, mostly in eastern Europe, and in the case of the USA it seems that *third* wave would be more descriptive. I may be reading more into this than is really there, but it seems suggestive.

Do you have a link that looks at cost benefit of widespread testing? Because my estimate below says it is extremely wasteful. Spending hundreds of millions or billions of dollars testing tens or hundreds of thousands of people to save one life is not a wise allocation of resources. You can use those resources to save many more lives by doing something else, so the waste is effectively killing people due to neglecting more effective interventions.

The  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the urgent  need for effective preventive vaccination to reduce burden and spread  of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)  in humans. Intranasal vaccination is an attractive strategy to prevent  COVID-19 as the nasal mucosa represents the first-line barrier to  SARS-CoV-2 entry before viral spread to the lung. Although SARS-CoV-2  vaccine development is rapidly progressing, the current intramuscular  vaccines are designed to elicit systemic immunity without conferring  mucosal immunity. Here, we show that AdCOVID, an intranasal adenovirus  type 5 (Ad5)-vectored vaccine encoding the receptor binding domain (RBD)  of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, elicits a strong and focused immune  response against RBD through the induction of mucosal IgA, serum  neutralizing antibodies and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with a Th1-like  cytokine expression profile. Therefore, AdCOVID, which promotes  concomitant systemic and local mucosal immunity, represents a promising  COVID-19 vaccine candidate.",1,t2_1kvnkx,2020-10-12 16:18:11,/r/COVID19/comments/j9mi28/singledose_intranasal_administration_of_adcovid/g8korhd/,0
COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j99dzl,t1_g8kipzq,g8kotbg,"&gt;Most of the reports I have read, however, suggest a different explanation. They ascribe this to better, more effective, medical care of hospitalized patients.

Sure, improved treatment is one of the confounding factors but what doesn't reconcile with this explanation is why hospitals don't appear to be overrun as they were back in March &amp; April.  The *reported* case numbers in Europe now are well above the peak numbers *reported* back in March-April (and I understand that the reporting process should be more accurate now). 

Something is 'safer' about this 2nd wave that is keeping those infected out of hospitals. Part of the explanation will be that the more vulnerable are more isolated but I think it's more than this. People were oblivious to the toxicity of airborne virus during the first wave and I think there were many many 'megadose' and 'sustained dose' infections.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The objection I would raise to what you suggested is that 'infective dose' will be much more mirrored in positive cases than in fatality rates. Once a disease gets going it gets going good and proper however many enemies invaded at the beginning and whether you will die or not is much more dependent on other factors. 

I disagree here. Dose related mortality has been [demonstrated in mice with H1N1 flu](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acel.12893). No such study has been done with humans of course but it has been demonstrated that [airborne infectious doses of flu are orders of magnitude lower than intranasal doses](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18848358/).  I don't think Covid-19 is one disease either..   if virus is kept away from those pulmonary ACE2 receptors then you probably get an URTI and disease is much milder. If virus does reach lungs then your outcome will depend on density of receptors, the dose, and host immune factors. Crudely speaking, the battle will be between viral replication kinetics versus adaptive immune response (not overlooking that some will have dysfunctional immune responses).   If virus has a huge head start then more likely it will win.   I think it will transpire that the transmission event and dose will be more relevant in determining outcomes with Sars-CoV-2 than with flu but I won't elaborate here.",1,t2_5zu9thqe,2020-10-12 16:19:12,/r/COVID19/comments/j99dzl/narrative_review_of_nonpharmaceutical_behavioural/g8kotbg/,0

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j99dzl,t1_g8kotbg,g8ktnwc,"I can see a problem with the mouse paper. The two cohorts were given *exactly* !!! the same dose of virus. The difference was in the volume of the diluent, not the amount of virus. It seems to be a significant paper in terms of experimental design, but I can't see how it has any application to natural conditions aside from somebody being exposed to the virus in rooms with different levels of 'mist'. What the experimenters seem to have demonstrated is that at a certain point with a certain volume of liquid the pulmonary clearance of the mice is overwhelmed. The question that comes out of this to me is whether smokers are more susceptible to Covid 19 and, if so, does it affect the mortality rate. The [WHO's advise](https://www.who.int/westernpacific/news/q-a-detail/q-a-on-tobacco-and-covid-19) on this could use a rewrite for clarity. In point one of their factoids they say;

&gt;At the time of preparing this Q&amp;A, there are no peer-reviewed studies that have evaluated the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with smoking. However, tobacco smokers (cigarettes, waterpipes, bidis, cigars, heated tobacco products) may be more vulnerable to contracting COVID-19, as the act of smoking involves contact of fingers (and possibly contaminated cigarettes) with the lips, which increases the possibility of transmission of viruses from hand to mouth. Smoking waterpipes, also known as shisha or hookah, often involves the sharing of mouth pieces and hoses, which could facilitate the transmission of the COVID-19 virus in communal and social settings.

While in point two they say; 

&gt;Smoking any kind of tobacco reduces lung capacity and increases the risk of many respiratory infections and can increase the severity of respiratory diseases. COVID-19 is an infectious disease that primarily attacks the lungs. Smoking impairs lung function making it harder for the body to fight off coronaviruses and other respiratory diseases.  Available research suggests that smokers are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 outcomes and death.  

Perhaps they are saying that there IS some research that says smokers are more likely to get sicker (and die of course), but perhaps they are merely extrapolating as they did in point one. *Which* ""available research""? On Covid 19 ? On any other respiratory virus ? Or just on the general effects of smoking. 

If point one is correct then I can see a great research proposal for an academic in it. I think it would easily gain funding, and the data may be available in case reports in certain hospitals. All you'd have to do is demonstrate increased incidence of smokers in the case load as compared to the general population. It might be difficult in places such as Greece or China where everybody and his dog smokes. Picture a Chihuahua with a half smoked butt in his mouth. It might also have relevance to the observed sex difference in Covid 19 between men and women and, if so, deserves correcting for in the analysis.

That is their initial plan.

They will be able to vaccinate this group rather quickly (in relative terms, we are talking months, not years). Remember, this virus is no more lethal than the other endemic viruses circulating around to the average young, healthy person, so it would be remiss to add them into the initial vaccination queue.

The most logical idea would be to provide immunity to the most vulnerable while eliminating the pandemic potential of the virus. If they achieve this through the vaccination of 50+, frontline workers and at risk groups, then they have achieved the goal.

It’s worth saying that the government has distanced itself from what she’s said. Official government line is that the vaccines task force does not determine this (they do vaccine procurement), and no decision on who will or won’t get vaccinated will be made until specifics of the vaccine are known. 

Matt Hancock, health minister, pointed to the JCVI interim guidelines when asked about this and said the government would go by what JCVI recommend: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/priority-groups-for-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccination-advice-from-the-jcvi-25-september-2020/jcvi-updated-interim-advice-on-priority-groups-for-covid-19-vaccination This does not rule our vaccinating under-50s and also says that vaccinating people most likely to transmit would be considered.

&gt; We suggested that IL-33, which is released upon cellular damage, may function as an endogenous danger signal or alarmin, similar to IL-1α or high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1). Here, we investigated the possibility that IL-33 activity may be regulated by proteases released during inflammation. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches, we demonstrate that neutrophil serine proteases cathepsin G and elastase can cleave full-length human IL-331–270 and generate mature forms IL-3395–270, IL-3399–270, and IL-33109–270. These forms are produced by activated human neutrophils ex vivo, are biologically active in vivo, and have a ∼10-fold higher activity than full-length IL-33 in cellular assays. Murine IL-33 is also cleaved by neutrophil cathepsin G and elastase, and both full-length and cleaved endogenous IL-33 could be detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in an in vivo model of acute lung injury associated with neutrophil infiltration. We propose that the inflammatory microenvironment may exacerbate disease-associated functions of IL-33 through the generation of highly active mature forms.",1,t2_1cjxsc7q,2020-10-12 19:49:30,/r/COVID19/comments/j9iy8i/imperfect_storm_is_interleukin33_the_achilles/g8kzwmi/,0

T-cell immunity is likely to play a role in protection against SARS-CoV-2 by helping generate neutralizing antibodies. We longitudinally studied CD4 T-cell responses to the M, N, and S structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in 21 convalescent individuals. Within the first two months following symptom onset, a majority of individuals (81%) mount at least one CD4 T-cell response, and 48% of individuals mount detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific peripheral T follicular helper cells (pTfh, defined as CXCR5+PD1+ CD4 T cells). SARS-CoV-2-specific pTfh responses across all three protein specificities correlate with antibody neutralization with the strongest correlation observed for S protein-specific responses. When examined over time, pTfh responses increase in frequency and magnitude in convalescence, and robust responses with magnitudes greater than 5% were detected only at the second convalescent visit, an average of 38 days post-symptom onset. These data deepen our understanding of antigen-specific pTfh responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that M and N protein-specific pTfh may also assist in the development of neutralizing antibodies and that pTfh response formation may be delayed in SARS-CoV-2 infection.",1,t2_blqmw,2020-10-12 21:26:14,/r/COVID19/comments/j9qu47/sarscov2specific_peripheral_t_follicular_helper/g8l7ew4/,0

**Aim**

To estimate time to recovery/convalescence and identify determinants among COVID-19 infected patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

**Methods**

A prospective cohort study was conducted among a randomly selected sample of 360 COVID-19 patients who were on follow up from 2nd June to 5th July 2020. Kaplan Meier plots, median survival times, and Log-rank test were used to describe the data and compare survival distribution between groups. Association between time to recovery/ convalescence and determinants was assessed using the Cox proportional hazard survival model, where hazard ratio, P-value, and 95% CI for hazard ratio were used for testing significance.

**Results**

The mean age of the participants was 32.4 years (+/_ 12.5 years). On admission, 86.9 % had mild COVID-19, 78.6% were asymptomatic and 11.4% of the patients had a history of pre-existing co-morbid illness. The Median time to recovery/ convalescence among the study population was 16 days. The log-rank test shows that having non-mild (moderate and severe) disease, having one or more symptoms at presentation, and presenting with respiratory and constitutional symptoms seems to extend the time needed to achieve recovery. The Final Cox regression result shows that the presence of symptom at presentation was found to be a significant factor that affects time to recovery/ convalescence, the rate of achieving recovery/ convalescence among symptomatic patients was 44% lower than patients who were asymptomatic at presentation (HR= 0.560, 95% CI= 0.322-0.975, p-value=0.040).

**Conclusions**

Presence of symptom was found to be associated with delayed viral clearance. This implies symptomatic patients are more likely to be infectious because of the prolonged viral shedding in addition to the presence of a more concentrated virus in the upper respiratory tract that enhances the transmission. Therefore, attention should be given in the isolation and treatment practice of COVID-19 patients with regard to presence of symptom.",1,t2_blqmw,2020-10-12 21:27:47,/r/COVID19/comments/j9qut6/determinants_of_time_to_convalescence_among/g8l7jy7/,0

As to serious attempts of quantifying the impact of track and trace strategies as well as testing and their economics: This is inseparable from overall strategies and overall estimates of the cost of the Pandemic. For simple reasons: Any measure in a set of reproduction-number lowering strategies, which in total lower the effective reproduction number to below 1, prevent exponential growth. And therefore evety single of these measures could be attributed with preventing the total cost that would come with unrestrained exponential growth until saturation effects kick in.

So the real question is: Does track and trace reduce the effective R? By how much? Are there additional effects? (informing political &amp; public health measures as well as population response)? Are there alternative methods? How much do they cost? What is the total cost of all measures, compared with the total cost of just allowing exponential growth?

Take some percentage out of those avoidable cases to require hospital treatment. Then no-contact-tracing implies an amount of required medical resources (money, staff, ICU's) which grows exponentially in time (as compared to contact tracing).

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j9twlm,t3_j9twlm,g8lpx67,"#Abstract

**Background**

Clinic-based estimates of SARS-CoV-2 may considerably underestimate the total number of infections. Access to testing in the US has been heterogeneous and symptoms vary widely in infected persons. Public health surveillance efforts and metrics are therefore hampered by underreporting. We set out to provide a minimally biased estimate of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among adults for a large and diverse county (Orange County, CA, population 3.2 million).

**Methods**

We implemented a surveillance study that minimizes response bias by recruiting adults to answer a survey without knowledge of later being offered SARS-CoV-2 test. Several methodologies were used to retrieve a population-representative sample. Participants (n=2,979) visited one of 11 drive-thru test sites from July 10th to August 16th, 2020 (or received an in-home visit) to provide a finger pin-prick sample. We applied a robust SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Microarray technology, which has superior measurement validity relative to FDA-approved tests.

**Findings**

Participants include a broad age, gender, racial/ethnic, and income representation. Adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 11.5% (95%CI: 10.5% to 12.4%). Formal bias analyses produced similar results. Prevalence was elevated among Hispanics (vs. other non-Hispanic: prevalence ratio [PR]= 1.47, 95% CI: 1.22 to 1.78) and household income &lt;$50,000 (vs. &gt;$100,000: PR= 1.42, 95% CI: 1.14 to 1.79).

**Interpretation**

Results from a diverse population using a highly specific and sensitive microarray indicate a SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of ~12 percent. This population-based seroprevalence is seven-fold greater than that using official County statistics. In this region, SARS-CoV-2 also disproportionately affects Hispanic and low-income adults.",2,t2_blqmw,2020-10-13 00:17:57,/r/COVID19/comments/j9twlm/estimated_seroprevalence_of_sarscov2_antibodies/g8lpx67/,0

Currently, airborne transmission is seen as the most important transmission path for SARS-CoV-2. In this investigation, models of other researchers with the aim to predict an infection risk for exposed persons in a room through aerosols emitted by an infectious case-patient were extended. As a novelty parameters or boundary conditions, namely the non-stationarity of aerosol and the half life of aerosolized virus, were included and a new method for determining the quanta emission rate based on measurements of the particle emission rate and respiratory rate at different types of activities was implemented. As a second step, the model was applied to twelve outbreaks to compare the predicted infection risk with the observed attack rate. To estimate a 'credible interval' of the predicted infection risk the quanta emission rate, the respiratory rate as well as the air volume flow were varied.

In nine out of twelve outbreaks, the calculated predicted infection risk via aerosols was found to be in the range the attack rate (with the variation of the boundary conditions) and reasons for the observed larger divergence were discussed. 

The validation was considered successful and therefore, the use of the model could be recommended to predict the risk of an infection via aerosols in given situations. Furthermore, appropriate preventive measures can be designed.",1,t2_blqmw,2020-10-13 00:19:43,/r/COVID19/comments/j9ty4p/predicted_infection_risk_via_aerosols/g8lq4q6/,0

And I'm not talking about deaths being exponential. I'm talking about the number of cases (in the early stages of a wave, before serious lockdown measures take effect) being exponential.

In particular, I'm talking about the number of cases with no contact tracing *minus* the number of cases with contact tracing. I'm lower bounding that number with an exponential --by only considering the contributions of asymptomatic cases infecting other asymptomatic cases. That's why symptomatic transmitters dont enter my argument, but sure, if you've got a very big envelope you can include them and drill my point even further.

Why exponentials? That's the entire point... because as soon as you have an exponential going on for a month (look at the cases in France for the past month, for example), your linear spending in tests will be pocket change compared to how much you just saved in prevention.

Severe acquired respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In severe COVID-19 cases, higher antibody titers against seasonal coronaviruses have been observed than in mild cases. To investigate antibody cross-reactivity as potential explanation for severe disease, we determined the kinetics, breadth, magnitude and level of cross-reactivity of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal CoV nucleocapsid and spike from 17 severe COVID-19 cases at the clonal level. Although patients mounted a mostly type-specific SARS-CoV-2 response, B-cell clones directed against seasonal CoV dominated and strongly increased over time. Seasonal CoV IgG responses that did not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 were boosted well beyond detectable cross-reactivity, particularly for HCoV-OC43 spike. These findings support a back-boost of poorly protective coronavirus-specific antibodies in severe COVID-19 patients that may negatively impact de novo SARS-CoV-2 immunity, reminiscent of original antigenic sin.",1,t2_blqmw,2020-10-13 01:02:33,/r/COVID19/comments/j9ur15/severe_covid19_patients_display_a_back_boost_of/g8lv8jt/,0

A better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from children and adolescents is crucial for informing public health mitigation strategies. We conducted a retrospective cohort study among household contacts of primary cases defined as children and adolescents aged 7-19 years with laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection acquired during an overnight camp outbreak. Among household contacts, we defined secondary cases using the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists definition. Among 526 household contacts of 224 primary cases, 48 secondary cases were identified, corresponding to a secondary attack rate of 9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7%-12%).

The COVID-19 pandemic presents an urgent health crisis. Human neutralizing antibodies (hNAbs) that target the host ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike1–5 show therapeutic promise and are being evaluated clincally6–8. To determine structural correlates of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, we solved 8 new structures of distinct COVID-19 hNAbs5 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer or RBD. Structural comparisons allowed classification into categories: (1) VH3-53 hNAbs with short CDRH3s that block ACE2 and bind only to “up” RBDs, (2) ACE2-blocking hNAbs that bind both “up” and “down” RBDs and can contact adjacent RBDs, (3) hNAbs that bind outside the ACE2 site and recognize “up” and “down” RBDs, and (4) Previously-described antibodies that do not block ACE2 and bind only “up” RBDs9. Class 2 comprised four hNAbs whose epitopes bridged RBDs, including a VH3-53 hNAb that used a long CDRH3 with a hydrophobic tip to bridge between adjacent “down” RBDs, thereby locking the spike into a closed conformation. Epitope/paratope mapping revealed few interactions with host-derived N-glycans and minor contributions of antibody somatic hypermutations to epitope contacts. Affinity measurements and mapping of naturally-occurring and in vitro-selected spike mutants in 3D provided insight into the potential for SARS-CoV-2 escape from antibodies elicited during infection or delivered therapeutically. These classifications and structural analyses provide rules for assigning current and future human RBD-targeting antibodies into classes, evaluating avidity effects, suggesting combinations for clinical use, and providing insight into immune responses against SARS-CoV-2.",1,t2_fzsa6,2020-10-13 02:03:56,/r/COVID19/comments/j9vzj7/sarscov2_neutralizing_antibody_structures_inform/g8m2kvy/,0

### Abstract

### Introduction

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for COVID‐19 is presently being used off‐label or within a clinical trial.

### Objectives

We investigated a multinational COVID‐19 patient database of real world data containing outcomes and their relationship to HCQ use. The primary outcome was all‐cause mortality within 30 days follow‐up.

### Methods

Retrospective cohort study of patients receiving HCQ within 48 hours of hospital admission. Medications, preexisting conditions, clinical measures on admission, and outcomes were recorded.

### Results

Among patients with a diagnosis of COVID‐19 in our propensity matched cohort, the mean ages±SD were 62.3±15.9 years (53.7% male) and 61.9±16.0 years (53.0% male) in the HCQ and no‐HCQ groups, respectively. There was no difference in overall 30‐day mortality between the HCQ and no‐HCQ groups (HCQ 13.1%, n=367; No‐HCQ 13.6%, n=367; OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.62‐1.46) after propensity‐matching. Although statistically insignificant, the HCQ/azithromycin (AZ) group had an overall mortality rate of 14.6% (n=199) compared with propensity matched no HCQ/+AZ cohort’s rate of 12.1% (n=199) (OR 1.24; 95% CI 0.70‐2.22). Importantly, however, there was no trend in this cohort’s overall mortality/arrhythmogenesis outcome (HCQ/AZ 17.1%, No‐HCQ/No AZ 17.1%; OR 1.0; 95% CI 0.6‐1.7).

### Conclusions

We report from a large retrospective multinational database analysis of COVID‐19 outcomes with HCQ and overall mortality in hospitalized patients. There was no statistically significant increase in mortality and mortality/arrhythmia with HCQ or HCQ/AZ.",1,t2_2g8zpegv,2020-10-13 02:19:42,/r/COVID19/comments/j9wbgf/hydroxychloroquine_in_hospitalized_covid19/g8m4g2b/,0

In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Richard L Tillett and colleagues describe the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in the USA.2 A 25-year-old man from the US state of Nevada, *who had no known immune disorders*, had PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in April, 2020 (cycle threshold [Ct] value 35·24; specimen A). He recovered in quarantine, testing negative by RT-PCR at two consecutive timepoints thereafter. However, 48 days after the initial test, the patient tested positive again by RT-PCR (Ct value 35·31; specimen B). Viral genome sequencing showed that both specimens A and B belonged to clade 20C, a predominant clade seen in northern Nevada. However, the genome sequences of isolates from the first infection (specimen A) and reinfection (specimen B) differed significantly, making the chance of the virus being from the same infection small. What is worrisome is that SARS-CoV-2 reinfection resulted in worse disease than did the first infection, requiring oxygen support and hospitalisation. The patient had positive antibodies after the reinfection, but whether he had pre-existing antibody after the first infection is unknown (table).",2,t2_fzsa6,2020-10-13 07:38:21,/r/COVID19/comments/ja1umc/what_reinfections_mean_for_covid19/g8n46mc/,0

But I believe most practitioners are reluctant to apply it without a relatively confident estimate of those probabilities, as you also are here. That seems to me like it loses the spirit. A gambler has no rigorous methodology for calculating who's going to win a football game, but they still manage to convert their beliefs into a number and place their bets.

Attempting the same here, perhaps there's a 40% chance that masks don't help much, 40% chance they'd avert 100k deaths, and 20% chance they'd avert 300k? That's an expected value of 100k deaths averted. Assuming 10 QALY per death and $100k per QALY, that's $100B, or about $300 per person. That ten years is probably an overestimate, but there's QALY lost to non-fatal suffering too; at least, it's probably not just one year, and it's probably not a hundred.

So is the average American indifferent between wearing a mask and $300? I said ""very good bet"", and that was probably too strong; but I think it's at least in the ballpark. At least, the masks seem a lot closer to cost-effective by that standard than pretty much any other NPI deployed against the coronavirus.

I'm generally in favor of mask orders, but against facility closures except for the highest-risk businesses (nightclubs, theaters, etc.) and for work that's easily done from home.

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_ja2mh6,t3_ja2mh6,g8n6u2f,"From Mayo Clinic: 

Although anticoagulants such as unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH, e.g. enoxaparin) are both being used for therapeutic mitigation of COVID associated coagulopathy (CAC), differences in their clinical outcomes remain to be investigated. Here, we employ automated neural networks supplemented with expert curation (‘augmented curation’) for retrospectively analyzing the complete electronic health records (EHRs) of 671 hospitalized COVID-19 patients administered either enoxaparin or unfractionated heparin, but not both. We find that COVID-19 patients administered unfractionated heparin but not enoxaparin have higher rates of mortality (risk ratio: 2.6; 95% C.I.: [1.2-5.4]; p-value: 0.02; BH adjusted p-value: 0.09), thrombotic events (risk ratio: 5.7, 95% C.I.: [2.1, 33.9], p-value: 0.024), acute kidney injury (risk ratio: 5.5; 95% C.I.: [1.2-17.7]; p-value: 0.02; BH adjusted p-value: 0.10), and bacterial pneumonia (risk ratio undefined; 95% C.I.: [1.0, 292]; p-value:0.02; BH adjusted p-value:0.10), compared to patients administered enoxaparin but not unfractionated heparin. Notably, even after controlling for potential confounding factors such as demographics, comorbidities, admission diagnosis, initial ICU status, and initial level of oxygen support, the above differences between the enoxaparin and unfractionated heparin patient cohorts remain statistically significant. This study emphasizes the need for mechanistically investigating differential modulation of the COVID- associated coagulation cascades by enoxaparin versus unfractionated heparin.",1,t2_wz0c9,2020-10-13 08:04:52,/r/COVID19/comments/ja2mh6/enoxaparin_is_associated_with_lower_rates_of/g8n6u2f/,0

Three authors led by Luis Ayerbe, Queen Mary U of London  &amp; Madrid, Spain  Sept 2020

clinical data, up to the 24th of April 2020, from the 2075 patients with COVID-19, admitted in 17 hospitals in Spain

many variables were extracted for this study!

Hydroxychloroquine had been used in 1857 patients. Hydroxychloroquine was associated with lower mortality when the model was adjusted for age and gender, with OR (95% CI): 0.44 (0.29–0.67). This association remained significant when saturation of oxygen &lt; 90% and temperature &gt; 37 °C were added to de model with OR 0.45 (0.30–0.68) p &lt; 0.001, and also when all the other drugs, and time of admission, were included as covariates.

Patients had been diagnosed with polymerase chain reaction test

HCQ was **started immediately after admission,** and it was stopped if any abnormalities were identified in the ECGs that were done on a daily basis 

HCQ was dosed as 400 mg twice daily the first day, followed by 200 mg twice daily for 4–6 days.

mean age was 67.57      Patients were not randomized

However, none of the \[nine\]studies that we have reviewed, reporting no benefit on HCQ, show an increased mortality associated with it 

Notes from Description of Cohort Table:

2/3 had O2 saturation &lt;90%, more often in males, were more likely to die. 

Those admitted towards the end of the study were much less likely to die (10%) than those near the beginning of the study (22%)! 

Receiving HCQ:    237 (12.76%) died out of 1857    Not receive HCQ:   49 (30.25%)  died out of 162 \[ not a typo due to copy and paste of all HCQ numbers \]

Model 1 Adjusted for age and gender  :  OR 0.44

Model 2 Adjusted for \[above plus\], temperature &gt; 37 °C, and saturation of oxygen &lt; 90%: 0.45

Model 3 Adjusted for   \[above plus\],  treatment with azithromycin, steroids, heparin, tocilizumab, a combination of lopinavir with ritonavir, and oseltamivir: 0.39 

Model 4 Adjusted for \[above plus\], and date of admission: 0.39

The Boulware / U of MN studies of HCQ did not report any benefit; however when someone else evaluated the raw data the following was reported [here.](http://covexit.com/accidental-heroes-in-the-search-for-a-cure-for-covid-19/)

""The McGill \[-Boulware\] researchers had only looked for statistical significance after 1 day, 2 days, 3 days or 4 days, and did not find any. ""

“We conclude their randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial presents statistical evidence, at 99% confidence level, that the treatment of Covid-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine is effective...""

“For 0 to 2 days after exposure to virus, the estimated relative reduction in symptomatic outcomes is 72% after 0 days, 48.9% after 1 day and 29.3% after 2 days.”

The Watanbe paper. [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.09477.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.09477.pdf)

In the HCQ study at the Henry Ford health system in Michigan they started roughly 85% of the treated participants on HCQ on the first day.   Death rate was cut in half for treated patients.

The Henry Ford study reported a roughly 5% improvement in mortality in those who received azithromycin along with HCQ.

The Ayerbe study reported:   Receiving AZT:  Death 11.94% vs 17.59% not.

Notice the HUGE difference in death rate in the early days of the study 22% vs around 10% towards the end of the study!  What factor(s) was causing that huge difference?

We've seen quite a number of studies correlating low vitamin D with a worse outcome, [for example](https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/review-vitamin-d-immune-health/); however, would there be a big difference in vitamin D from sun exposure in just a month from late March to late April in Spain?

They say they adjusted for date of admission in ""Model 4"" yet the OR was the same as in Model 3 that did not include that adjustment.

Was there a big increase in mask utilization during the study that could have resulted in a reduced exposure to viral particles (lower inoculum)?

**Summary**

a consistent negative relationship was found between relative humidity and cases. Overall, a decrease in relative humidity of 1% was associated with an increase in cases of 7–8%. Overall, we found no relationship with between cases and temperature, rainfall or wind speed. Information generated in this study confirms humidity as a driver of SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission.

\[referring to a study from 2010\] Temperature and relative humidity can affect coronavirus transmission, through virus survival (at lower temperatures coronaviruses survive longer) and the length of time infectious respiratory matter stays suspended in the air (at lower humidity more material stay suspended for longer).

**Additional Info**

\[[Journal of Virology entry](https://jvi.asm.org/content/88/14/7692) on Flu seasonality\] Relative humidity can change the size and composition of virus-carrying respiratory droplets. At lower relative humidity, the salts in respiratory droplet may crystallize out leading to lower salt concentrations that are better for virus survival. Less water vapor in the air can also result in more evaporation of water from respiratory droplets, leading to smaller respiratory droplet size. Smaller droplets may travel further and hang in the air longer. These droplets may have higher concentrations of live virus as well.

[As a Short Communication in the *International Journal of Infectious Diseases* suggested](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220304707), the more virus that first gets into your respiratory tract, the worse the infection may end up being. Therefore, if the respiratory droplets tend to have higher amounts of active virus when the temperature and humidity drop, the resulting infections could be more dangerous.

A 1% decrease in relative humidity was predicted to increase cases about 7–8%, with a more pronounced effect at a relative humidity &lt;75–79%. In almost all PHUs this negative relationship between relative humidity and cases was found.",1,t2_ii8qh,2020-10-13 10:14:31,/r/COVID19/comments/ja4ffs/humidity_is_a_consistent_climatic_factor/g8nk8qb/,0

Because there are abstract commonalities that you can use when you have enough experience in a given area. 

Simple example: you're an independent contractor with over a decade of experience in your field.  You need to quote out a project to build something you've never specifically done before.  But you've built enough intuitive knowledge in the field to have a reasonably accurate picture in your head of all the components and how they will come together.

It's kind of like that.  They have enough experience to say that trial phases typically take *x* amount of time, how significantly bumps in the road will impact the progress, combining that with the fact pharmaceuticals are expediting their stages with a lot of overlap through combined phases, production at risk, and rolling regulatory reviews.  Not to mention, the unprecedented global collaboration.

Maybe I'm optimistic, but I'd prefer to trust the experts on this.

&gt;Never before has there been an international effort to create a vaccine while there is a rapidly spreading novel respiratory illness. 

I mean, yeah, that's kind of the whole point.

Studies of antibody kinetics have all, with a couple exceptions (Long et al), shown stable titers out to the end of the study. Usually 3-4 months so far.

There are two types of re-infection studies, the first is population based, and estimate re-infections based on the time gap between the first and second infection. The Qatar study is the best example of this, and they found a re-infection risk of 0.01%, and the re-infection cases were mild. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.20179457v2
(This was in a crowded region of the world, nations that can practice better physical distancing should have even lower risks of re-infection.)

The second type are case studies. The Nevada case was one of those. Case studies only look at particularly interesting cases, because this type of study require expensive genomic sequencing to confirm that the first and second infections were different. Most people who are mild or asymptomatic on their re-infections do not get tested, let alone get scientists to do genomics studies on them. The first confirmed case was a man from Hong Kong who had to get tested because he was travelling. He was asymptomatic, and tested positive. He would never have known that he was re-infected if he didn't travel through a checkpoint. The Nevada case only got genomic confirmation of the re-infection because the infection happened to be serious. The first person to die from a confirmed re-infection was a woman who was on a cancer treatment that depleted her immune system's memory cells, for her the second infection was functional identical to the first because her body was unable to remember the first infection. This type of study will be disproportionately about very unusual cases, because of heavy selection bias. 

In short, I would expect re-infections to be rare, and serious re-infections extremely rare.",4,t2_g1t74,2020-10-13 11:14:40,/r/COVID19/comments/j9rc3r/weekly_question_thread_week_of_october_12/g8nqcgv/,0

&gt; Does infection by different viral isolates mean we need a vaccine for each type? While differences in the viral genome sequence of the various isolates are a great way to know if an individual is reinfected (ruling out reactivation of lingering virus infection), it does not indicate that the second infection was due to immune evasion.

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_j9ur15,t1_g8lzyuy,g8nxnqf,"They seem to have invented/coopted new jargon here but the reason SARS vaccines were stopped is because weak (low quantity and/or affinity) antibodies seemed to increase the severity of illness in animal and cell culture models.

This seems to mean the same thing:

&gt; Seasonal CoV IgG responses that did not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 were boosted well beyond detectable cross-reactivity, particularly for HCoV-OC43 spike. These findings support a back-boost of poorly protective coronavirus-specific antibodies in severe COVID-19 patients that may negatively impact de novo SARS-CoV-2 immunity, reminiscent of original antigenic sin.

People have known this is very likely since at least February. Here are a few papers on SARS about it:



&gt; To evaluate the efficacy of existing vaccines against infection with SHC014-MA15, we vaccinated aged mice with double-inactivated whole SARS-CoV (DIV). Previous work showed that DIV could neutralize and protect young mice from challenge with a homologous virus14; however, the vaccine failed to protect aged animals in which augmented immune pathology was also observed, indicating the possibility of the animals being harmed because of the vaccination15. Here we found that DIV did not provide protection from challenge with SHC014-MA15 with regards to weight loss or viral titer (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). Consistent with a previous report with other heterologous group 2b CoVs15, serum from DIV-vaccinated, aged mice also failed to neutralize SHC014-MA15 (Supplementary Fig. 5c). Notably, DIV vaccination resulted in robust immune pathology (Supplementary Table 4) and eosinophilia (Supplementary Fig. 5d–f). Together, these results confirm that the DIV vaccine would not be protective against infection with SHC014 and could possibly augment disease in the aged vaccinated group.
https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3985

&gt; We found that higher concentrations of anti-sera against SARS-CoV neutralized SARS-CoV infection, while highly diluted anti-sera significantly increased SARS-CoV infection and induced higher levels of apoptosis. Results from infectivity assays indicate that SARS-CoV ADE is primarily mediated by diluted antibodies against envelope spike proteins rather than nucleocapsid proteins. We also generated monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV spike proteins and observed that most of them promoted SARS-CoV infection. Combined, our results suggest that antibodies against SARS-CoV spike proteins may trigger ADE effects. The data raise new questions regarding a potential SARS-CoV vaccine, while shedding light on mechanisms involved in SARS pathogenesis.

Ivermectin Treatment May Improve the Prognosis of Patients With COVID-19

Summary:

This retrospective study of ivermectin use from Bangladesh which has authors from Bangladesh and Japan collected data on patients who had been previously treated into two arms:

- 115 received ivermectin plus standard care

- 133 received only standard care

----

Disease progression was better across the board for all metrics - ivermectin vs non-ivermectin:

- Developed moderate respiratory distress - 3 (2.6%)	 vs 21 (15.8%) - p&lt;0.001

- Developed pneumonia - 0 (0%) vs 13 (9.8%)

- Ischemic stroke - 0 (0%) vs 2 (1.5%)

- Required intensive care management -	1 (0.9%) vs 11 (8.3%)	 - p&lt;0.001

----

Clinical outcomes were better across the board for all metrics - ivermectin vs non-ivermectin:

- Duration of viral clearance, median (IQR) – day -	4 (4–6) vs 15 (12–17) - difference: 9.78 (8.97–10.59) - p	&lt;0.001

- Duration of hospital stay, median (IQR) - day - 	9 (7–10)	 vs 15 (12–19) - difference: 6.3 (5.09–7.51)	- p&lt;0.001

- Recovered and discharged - 114 (99.1) vs 124 (92.2)	 - difference: 0.516

- Death -	1 (0.9%)	vs 9 (6.8%)

Ivermectin And COVID-19: New Study On Viral Clearance, Hospital Length Of Stay, And Mortality.

Here we will discuss a new study that was published out of Bangladesh in a Spanish Respiratory Medicine Journal called Archivos De Bronconumologia looking at Ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. We will discuss what Ivermectin is, how it is theorized to work, and why it is being studied. We will then dive into the study including the doses of Ivermectin used, the study structure, the study population, and their findings. They found decreased development of moderate respiratory disease, decreased escalation to the intensive care unit, faster viral clearance (even compared to three other anti-virals), decreased length of stay in the hospital, and decreased mortality. Pretty impressive! What do these results mean? What are the limitations? Where to go from here?

My personal conclusion, common drugs, generic, low cost, statistically significant results, reduced mortality to 0%, minor stomach discomfort.  Likely would work better with HCQ+zinc+d3.

India has included Ivermectin, doxy, tylenols, blood ox and thermometer in home treatment kits with amazing preliminary results (no deaths recorded when kit used). 

Studies have also shown that ivermectin drops on tongue may be effective prophylaxis.

Findings

The median (IQR) arterial oxygen partial pressure to fraction inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2/FiO2) was 68 (54–92) in 293 enroled patients. Of these, 137/293 (47%) of patients [PaO2/FiO2 76 (63–93)] were successfully weaned from HFNO. The median duration of HFNO was 6 (3–9) in those successfully treated versus 2 (1–5) days in those who failed (p&lt;0.001). A higher ratio of oxygen saturation/FiO2 to respiratory rate within 6 h (ROX-6 score) after HFNO commencement was associated with HFNO success (ROX-6; AHR 0.43, 0.31–0.60), as was use of steroids (AHR 0.35, 95%CI 0.19–0.64). A ROX-6 score of ≥3.7 was 80% predictive of successful weaning whilst ROX-6 ≤ 2.2 was 74% predictive of failure. In total, 139 patents (52%) survived to hospital discharge, whilst mortality amongst HFNO failures with outcomes was 129/140 (92%).

Interpretation

In a resource-constrained setting, HFNO for severe COVID-19 HRF is feasible and more almost half of those who receive it can be successfully weaned without the need for mechanical ventilation.",1,t2_2k8wnwm4,2020-10-13 16:42:19,/r/COVID19/comments/ja9hti/the_utility_of_highflow_nasal_oxygen_for_severe/g8ocqdy/,0

The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is the target of vaccine design efforts to end the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite a low mutation rate, isolates with the D614G substitution in the S protein appeared early during the pandemic, and are now the dominant form worldwide. Here, we analyze the D614G mutation in the context of a soluble S ectodomain construct. Cryo-EM structures, antigenicity and proteolysis experiments suggest altered conformational dynamics resulting in enhanced furin cleavage efficiency of the G614 variant. Furthermore, furin cleavage alters the conformational dynamics of the Receptor Binding Domains (RBD) in the G614 S ectodomain, demonstrating an allosteric effect on the RBD dynamics triggered by changes in the SD2 region, that harbors residue 614 and the furin cleavage site. Our results elucidate SARS-CoV-2 spike conformational dynamics and allostery, and have implications for vaccine design.",1,t2_blqmw,2020-10-13 18:11:49,/r/COVID19/comments/ja8602/d614g_mutation_alters_sarscov2_spike/g8oh84o/,0

You're not the first person I've read speculate that the FDA might also be dragging their heels to allow an American candidate (in all likelihood Pfizer) to be the first to US approval. Taking things slowly, therefore, allows them to kill two birds with one stone: a public more confident that there's no political compromise on safety AND cater to American exceptionalism in the process.

When vaccines have had ""long term"" issues it's because it took that long to get them into enough trial subjects for one of them to have the rare adverse reaction, or for enough people in the trial group to get the disease to prove the null result (no efficacy). It's precisely because in a normal situation you don't get an immediate flood of participants when you start a trial, and the disease you're vaccinating against isn't rampant, it slows down the trial process and your chances of having an early failure considerably.

Recruiting for these vaccine trials has been incredibly fast, and the pandemic status of the vaccine means if the trial takes place in a 'hot spot' you could potentially see infections in the control group happen very quickly.

Remember how a vaccine works. You get one or two doses, and over the course of about six weeks your body generates an immune response. Almost all the side effects are going to happen immediately after dosing (in the two-dose trials, usually after the second dose specifically) and then if some sort of neurological side effect occurs it's going to show in the weeks after.

What doesn't happen is someone gets a vaccine then wakes up with transverse myelitis a year later.",1,t2_593zf,2020-10-13 21:25:36,/r/COVID19/comments/ja3iqa/johnson_johnson_temporarily_pauses_all_dosing_in/g8ouv14/,0

&gt;  
&gt;**Background** Ivermectin was shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in-vitro, which has led to off-label use, but clinical efficacy has not been previously described.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Research Question** Does ivermectin benefit hospitalized COVID-19 patients?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Study Design and Methods:** Charts of consecutive patients hospitalized at four Broward Health hospitals in Florida with confirmed COVID-19 between March 15 through May 11, 2020 treated with or without ivermectin were reviewed. Hospital ivermectin dosing guidelines were provided but treatment decisions were per treating physician’s discretion. The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included mortality in patients with severe pulmonary involvement, extubation rates for mechanically ventilated patients, and length of stay. Severe pulmonary involvement was defined as need for FiO2 ≥50%, noninvasive ventilation, or invasive ventilation at study entry. Logistic regression and propensity score matching were used to adjust for confounders.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Results** 280 patients, 173 treated with ivermectin and 107 without ivermectin, were reviewed. Most patients in both groups also received hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin. Univariate analysis showed lower mortality in the ivermectin group (15.0% versus 25.2%, OR 0.52, CI 0.29-0.96, P=0.03). Mortality was also lower among ivermectin-treated patients with severe pulmonary involvement (38.8% vs 80.7%, OR 0.15, CI 0.05-0.47, p=0.001). There were no significant differences in extubation rates (36.1% vs 15.4%, OR 3.11 (0.88-11.00), p=0.07) or length of stay. After multivariate adjustment for confounders and mortality risks, the mortality difference remained significant (OR 0.27, CI 0.09-0.80, p=0.03). 196 patients were included in the propensity-matched cohort. Mortality was significantly lower in the ivermectin group (13.3% vs 24.5%, OR 0.47, CI 0.22-0.99, p&lt;0.05); an 11.2% (CI 0.38%-22.1%) absolute risk reduction, with a number needed to treat of 8.9 (CI 4.5-263).  
&gt;  
&gt;**Interpretation** Ivermectin treatment was associated with lower mortality during treatment of COVID-19, especially in patients with severe pulmonary involvement. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.",1,t2_1g543a,2020-10-13 21:47:46,/r/COVID19/comments/jadh8t/use_of_ivermectin_is_associated_with_lower/g8owz69/,0

&gt; Remember how a vaccine works. You get one or two doses, and over the course of about six weeks your body generates an immune response. Almost all the side effects are going to happen immediately after dosing (in the two-dose trials, usually after the second dose specifically) and then if some sort of neurological side effect occurs it's going to show in the weeks after.

With a matter of days the vaccine itself is gone from your body. And then after the first few weeks after vaccination, once the desired reaction has been achieved, your immune system has basically gone back into stasis. If you're going to see a side effect, you're going to see it in this period when the reaction is strongest. After that, the way a vaccine works is not by taking up residence in your system, but by having stimulated your immune system to ""remember.""

So, while it's possible someone may become re-infected with one of the HCOVs, its not like its a common occurrence over the course of someone's lifetime. Regarding SARS-COV2, we have studies with N&gt;1 in environments with high infection risk that show reinfection with SARS-COV2 is possible but very rare over timeframes less than 4 months. I don't think picking up isolated cases of reinfection is very surprising given widespread testing and awareness of SARS-COV2.

The mechanisms that underpin COVID-19 disease severity, and determine the outcome of infection, are only beginning to be unraveled. The host inflammatory response contributes to lung injury, but circulating mediators levels fall below those in classical cytokine storms. We analyzed serial plasma samples from 619 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 recruited through the prospective multicenter ISARIC clinical characterization protocol U.K. study and 39 milder community cases not requiring hospitalization. Elevated levels of numerous mediators including angiopoietin-2, CXCL10, and GM-CSF were seen at recruitment in patients who later died. Markers of endothelial injury (angiopoietin-2 and von-Willebrand factor A2) were detected early in some patients, while inflammatory cytokines and markers of lung injury persisted for several weeks in fatal COVID-19 despite decreasing antiviral cytokine levels. Overall, markers of myeloid or endothelial cell activation were associated with severe, progressive, and fatal disease indicating a central role for innate immune activation and vascular inflammation in COVID-19.",1,t2_blqmw,2020-10-13 22:33:13,/r/COVID19/comments/jaelss/elevated_antiviral_myeloid_and_endothelial/g8p1p69/,0

The 3600 stored specimens tested to date were originally collected in late July and early August, the majority (2700) from primary care clinics in the Cape Town metropolitan area. 

The testing has been conducted by the NHLS using an automated serology assay in accordance with SAHPRA approved section 21 use. The assay had been demonstrated to have high sensitivity and specificity (91,2% and 99.7% respectively) in a local validation study of individuals with known past symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection or from specimens predating the epidemic. 

The results of the study revealed: 

The SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence in the tested specimens from Cape Town clinics was 40%.  
Higher seroprevalence was observed in HIV viral load (42%) compared to antenatal residual specimens (37%). 
Seroprevalence was higher in those from more densely populated subdistricts. 

It was also higher in women compared to men (33% for men with HIV compared to 45% for women with HIV).  
It is anticipated that prior infection in these selected public sector patient groups is substantially higher than in the general and public sector populations as a whole, and that there will additionally be wide variation in the seroprevalence across the province. The findings nevertheless provide a broad indication of the extent of COVID-19 transmission experienced to date in large parts of the province, in keeping with the epidemic trajectory we have seen.  

Robust population surveys are planned nationally which will provide more definitive results on population seroprevalence and variability, and these are anticipated to begin in the Western Cape in the coming weeks. More detailed analyses of the sentinel serological surveillance data will be forthcoming.",1,t2_2k8wnwm4,2020-10-13 22:46:34,/r/COVID19/comments/jaeurn/results_of_a_seroprevalence_study_in_the_cape/g8p35n5/,0

I handle ~3-4 clinical trials a week and assess more. It's an unfortunate fact that poorly described trials conducted in low and middle income countries have a *much* higher rate of major methodological, ethical and reporting issues. For instance, it emerged that the randomization methods had been falsified in an Indian trial I handled a few weeks ago - I only found out because a reviewer I invited told me that they had reviewed the trial for another journal, alerted them to the issues, and the authors rewrote their methods to hide the failings!

 But this doesn’t mean that things will go smoothly, which is why I wrote [**this earlier post**](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/08/25/preparing-for-the-vaccine-results).

In order to design actionable SARS-CoV-2 strategies, we extended the SEIRS model to support stratified isolation levels for healthy &lt;60 and vulnerable individuals. At first, we forced isolation levels to be uniform, showing that daily deaths curves of all metropolitan areas in the analysis can be fitted using homogeneous Ro=3.3. In the process, we established the possibility that an extremely short infectiousness period of 2 days coupled with 5 days exposure may be responsible for the multiple deaths valleys observed during the weeks following lockdowns.

Regardless of the infectiousness period, we realized that is possible to infer non-uniform isolation levels for healthy &lt;60 and vulnerable by forcing the model to match the &lt;60 to &gt;60 age serology ratio reported in seroprevalence studies. Since the serology ratio is more robust than absolute values, we argue immunity level estimations made in this way (Madrid 43%; Catalonia 24%; Brussels 73%; and Stockholm 65%) are closer to reality. In locations where we did not find reliable serology, we performed immunity estimations assuming Spain serology ratio (Paris: 24%; London: 34%). We predict that, with the exception of Brussels, no location can return to normal life without having a second wave (albeit in Stockholm a smaller one). For locations far from the herd immunity threshold (HIT) we searched what isolation values allow to return to normal life in 90 days minimizing final deaths, shockingly all found isolations for healthy &lt;60 were negative (i.e. coronavirus parties minimize final deaths). Then, assuming an ideal 1-day long vaccination campaign with a 77% efficacy vaccine, we compared predicted final deaths of those 90-day strategies for all possible vaccination dates with a 180-day long vaccine waiting strategy that imposes 0.40 mandatory isolation to healthy &lt;60 and results in 0.65 isolation to vulnerable. We found that 180-day of mandatory isolations to healthy &lt;60 (i.e. schools and workplaces closed) produces more final deaths if the vaccination date is later than (Madrid: March 7 2021; Catalonia: Dec 26 2020; Paris: Jan 12 2021; London: Jan 25 2021). 

We conclude that our 2-stratum SEIRS model is suitable to predict SARS-CoV-2 epidemic behavior and can be used to minimize covid-19 disease and isolations related damages.",1,t2_blqmw,2020-10-14 00:26:05,/r/COVID19/comments/jagttq/sarscov2_waves_in_europe_a_2stratum_seirs_model/g8peloe/,0

The COVID-19 pandemic has hit different parts of the world differently: some
regions are still in the rise of the first wave, other regions are now facing a decline
after a first wave, and yet other regions have started to see a second wave. The
current immunity level ˆi in a region is closely related to the cumulative fraction
infected, which primarily depends on two factors: a) the initial potential for COVID19 in the region (often quantified by the basic reproduction number R0), and b) the
timing, amount and effectiveness of preventive measures put in place. By means
of a mathematical model including heterogeneities owing to age, social activity and
susceptibility, and allowing for time-varying preventive measures, the risk for a new
epidemic wave and its doubling time, and how they depend on R0, ˆi and the overall
effect of the current preventive measures, are investigated. Focus lies on quantifying
the minimal overall effect of preventive measures pM in needed to prevent a future
outbreak. The first result shows that the current immunity level ˆi plays a more
influential roll than when immunity is obtained from vaccination. Secondly, by
comparing regions with different R0 and ˆi it is shown that regions with lower R0
and low ˆi may now need higher preventive measures (pM in) compared with other
regions having higher R0 but also higher ˆi, even when such immunity levels are far
from herd immunity.",1,t2_blqmw,2020-10-14 00:28:20,/r/COVID19/comments/jagvji/the_risk_for_a_new_covid19_wave_and_how_it/g8pevh2/,0

**Background**

There is always an uncertainty of epidemiological , serological infectivity and virulence of the emerging novel coronavirus. Antibody test can be used for assessing whether immunity has developed in the infected person after 5-7 days of illness and understand cumulative exposure levels to the infection, make inferences on the actual burden of infection, its geographical spread, effect on specific demographic/risk groups, gaps in testing and infection fatality rates. Objective- To estimate and compare the sero-prevalence, hidden prevalence and determine the demographic risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among adults in three largest cities of Odisha, India.

**Methodology**

This was a population based cross sectional serological survey carried out in August 2020 in the three largest cities of the state of Odisha. Sample size per city was estimated to be 1500 and participants were enrolled from the community using multi-stage random sampling from 25 clusters from each city. Data was collected using ODK based tools by household visits and 3-4 ml of blood samples were collected after informed consent. Samples were transported to testing lab where Serum was separated and tested for anti- SARS CoV-2 antibodies using automated CLIA platform. Statistical analysis was done using R-software packages.

**Results**

A total of 4146 participants from the 3 cities of Bhubaneswar (BBS), Berhampur (BAM) and Rourkela (RKL) participated. A total of 5635 households were approached and the average non response rate in the community was 17.4%. The gender weighted seroprevalence across the three cities was 20.78% (95% CI: 19.56%-22.05%). Seroprevalence was highest in BAM at 31.14% (95% CI: 28.69-33.66%) followed by 24.59% (95% CI: 22.39-26.88%) in RKL and 5.24% (95% CI: 4.10-6.58%) in BBS. While females reported a higher seroprevalence (22.8%) as compared to males (18.8%), there was no significant difference in seroprevalence across age groups. **A majority of the seropositive participants were asymptomatic (93.87%). Among those who reported symptoms, the most common symptom was fever (68.89%) followed by cough (46.06%) and myalgia (32.67%).** The case to infection ratio on the date of serosurvey was 1: 6.6 in BBS, 1:61 in BAM and 1:29.8 in RKL.

Prognostic models to predict the risk of clinical deterioration in acute COVID-19 are required to inform clinical management decisions. Among 75,016 consecutive adults across England, Scotland and Wales prospectively recruited to the ISARIC Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium (ISARIC4C) study, we developed and validated a multivariable logistic regression model for in-hospital clinical deterioration (defined as any requirement of ventilatory support or critical care, or death) using 11 routinely measured variables. We used internal-external cross-validation to show consistent measures of discrimination, calibration and clinical utility across eight geographical regions. We further validated the final model in held-out data from 8,252 individuals in London, with similarly consistent performance (C-statistic 0.77 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.78); calibration-in-the-large 0.01 (-0.04 to 0.06); calibration slope 0.96 (0.90 to 1.02)). Importantly, this model demonstrated higher net benefit than using other candidate scores to inform decision-making. Our 4C Deterioration model thus demonstrates unprecedented clinical utility and generalisability to predict clinical deterioration among adults hospitalised with COVID-19.",1,t2_blqmw,2020-10-14 00:33:17,/r/COVID19/comments/jagz5g/development_and_validation_of_the_4c/g8pfgc9/,0

The COVID-19 pandemic has been a significant cause of global morbidity and mortality, with evidence suggesting that activities involving heavier breathing, such as singing and exercise, can result in increased risk for disease transmission. The USA Curling Club Nationals is a week-long curling tournament to determine the men's and women's club-level champions. The 2020 tournament took place March 7-14 at the Potomac Curling Club in Laurel, MD, and featured teams from across the United States. Preventative measures, such as increased cleaning and disinfection of surfaces, single use and disposable food containers, and canceling traditional event banquets were implemented. Despite these measures, players, coaches, officials, volunteers, and spectators contracted the virus as a result of participation in the event. We surveyed participants to assess total positivity, potential days of transmission, and the burden of symptoms experienced among the participants.

We found that 55.6% of all participants reported experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19, with nearly all experiencing more than one symptom. Although most participants' symptoms resolved quickly, 9.6% of all participants experienced symptoms for at least one month and 12.6% of all participants reported taking at least 30 days before they felt they had returned to normal. 

As a result of this study, we believe curling tournaments have the potential to be high-risk events for the transmission of COVID-19. Further infection prevention measures that were not yet publicly implemented at the time of this tournament may be an effective method of lowering transmission risk, although further research is required.",2,t2_blqmw,2020-10-14 00:34:47,/r/COVID19/comments/jagzsb/estimating_the_burden_of_covid19_symptoms_among/g8pfmit/,0

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_jagzrh,t3_jagzrh,g8pfqta,"**Abstract**

During August 2020, we carried out a serological survey among students and employees at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST), Japan, testing for the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. We used a FDA-authorized 2-step ELISA protocol developed by the Krammer Lab in combination with at-home self-collection of blood samples using a custom low-cost finger prick-based capillary blood collection kit. Although our survey did not find any COVID-19 seropositive individuals among the OIST cohort, it reliably detected all positive control samples obtained from a local hospital and excluded all negatives controls. Among our controls, we found strong cross-reactivity of antibodies in samples from a serum pool from two MERS patients in the anti-SARS-CoV-2-S ELISA. Here we show that a centralized ELISA in combination with patient-based capillary blood collection using as little as one drop of blood can reliably assess the seroprevalence among communities. Anonymous sample tracking and an integrated website created a stream-lined procedure. Major parts of the workflow were automated on a liquid handler, demonstrating scalability. We anticipate this concept to serve as a prototype for reliable serological testing among larger populations.",1,t2_blqmw,2020-10-14 00:35:49,/r/COVID19/comments/jagzrh/covid19_serological_survey_using_micro_blood/g8pfqta/,0

**Objectives**

To investigate the role of ethnicity in COVID-19 outcome disparities in a cohort in Kuwait.

**Methods**

This is a retrospective analysis of 405 individuals infected with SARS-CoV2 in Kuwait. Outcomes such as symptoms severity and mortality were considered. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to report the odds ratios (OR) for ICU admission and dying from COVID-19.

**Results**

The cohort included 290 Arabs and 115 South Asians. South Asians recorded significantly higher COVID-19 death rates compared to Arabs (33% vs. 7.6%, P value&lt;0.001). When compared to Arabs, South Asians also had higher odds of being admitted to the ICU (OR = 6.28, 95% CI: 3.34-11.80, p &lt; 0.001). South Asian patients showed 7.62 (95% CI: 3.62-16.02, p &lt; 0.001) times the odds of dying from COVID-19.

**Conclusion**

COVID-19 patients with South Asians ethnicity are more likely to have worse prognosis and outcome when compared to patients with Arab ethnicity.

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_jahckd,t3_jahckd,g8phnnz,"**Abstract**

Virologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 has been central to the COVID-19 pandemic response, but interpreting changes in incidence and fraction of positive tests towards understanding the epidemic trajectory is confounded by changes in testing practices. 

Here, we show that the distribution of viral loads, in the form of Cycle thresholds (Ct), from positive surveillance samples at a single point in time can provide accurate estimation of an epidemic's trajectory, subverting the need for repeated case count measurements which are frequently obscured by changes in testing capacity. We identify a relationship between the population-level cross-sectional distribution of Ct values and the growth rate of the epidemic, demonstrating how the skewness and median of detectable Ct values change purely as a mathematical epidemiologic rule without any change in individual level viral load kinetics or testing. Although at the individual level measurement variation can complicate interpretation of Ct values for clinical use, we show that population-level properties reflect underlying epidemic dynamics. In support of these theoretical findings, we observe a strong relationship between the time-varying effective reproductive number, R(t), and the distribution of Cts among positive surveillance specimens, including median and skewness, measured in Massachusetts over time. We use the observed relationships to derive a novel method that allows accurate inference of epidemic growth rate using the distribution of Ct values observed at a single cross-section in time, which, unlike estimates based on case counts, is less susceptible to biases from delays in test results and from changing testing practices.

Our findings suggest that instead of discarding individual Ct values from positive specimens, incorporation of viral loads into public health data streams offers a new approach for real-time resource allocation and assessment of outbreak mitigation strategies, even where repeat incidence data is not available. Ct values or similar viral load data should be regularly reported to public health officials by testing centers and incorporated into monitoring programs.",1,t2_blqmw,2020-10-14 00:52:04,/r/COVID19/comments/jahckd/estimating_epidemiologic_dynamics_from_single/g8phnnz/,0

**Background**

COVID-19 disease (Coronavirus disease 2019) caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is widespread worldwide, affecting more than 11 million people globally (July 6th, 2020). Diagnostic techniques have been studied in order to contain the pandemic. Immunochromatographic (IC) assays are feasible and low cost alternative for monitoring the spread of COVID-19 in the population.

**Methods**

Here we evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of eleven different immunochromatografic tests in 98 serum samples from confirmed cases of COVID-19 through RT-PCR and 100 negative serum samples from blood donors collected in February 2019. Considering the endemic situation of Dengue in Brazil, we also evaluated the cross-reactivity with Dengue using 20 serum samples from patients with confirmed diagnosis for Dengue collected in early 2019 through four different tests. 

**Results**

Our results demonstrated agreement between immunochromatographic assays and RT-PCR, especially after 10 days since the onset of symptoms. The evaluation of IgG and IgM antibodies combined demonstrated a strong level of agreement (0.85) of IC assays and RT-PCR. It was observed cross-reactivity between Dengue and COVID-19 using four different IC assays for COVID-19 diagnosis. The specificity of IC assays to detected COVID-19 IgM antibodies using Dengue serum samples varied from 80% to 85%; the specificity of IgG detection was 100% and total antibody was 95%. 

**Conclusions**

We found high sensitivity, specificity and good agreement of IC assays, especially after 10 days onset of symptoms. However, we detected cross-reactivity between Dengue and COVID-19 mainly with IgM antibodies demonstrating the need for better studies about diagnostic techniques for these diseases.",1,t2_blqmw,2020-10-14 00:53:52,/r/COVID19/comments/jahdly/evaluation_of_eleven_immunochromatographic_assays/g8phvdq/,0

**Objective**: Develop and validate models that predict mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients admitted to the hospital.

**Design:** Retrospective cohort study

**Setting:** A multicenter cohort across ten Dutch hospitals including patients from February 27 to June 8 2020. 

**Participants:** SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (age ≥ 18) admitted to the hospital.

**Main Outcome Measures:** 21-day mortality evaluated by the area under the receiver operatory curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value. The predictive value of age was explored by comparison with age-based rules used in practice and by excluding age from analysis.

**Results:** 2273 patients were included, of whom 516 had died or discharged to palliative care within 21 days after admission. Five feature sets, including premorbid, clinical presentation and laboratory &amp; radiology values, were derived from 80 features. Additionally, an ANOVA-based data-driven feature selection selected the ten features with the highest F-values: age, number of home medications, urea nitrogen, lactate dehydrogenase, albumin, oxygen saturation (%), oxygen saturation is measured on room air, oxygen saturation is measured on oxygen therapy, blood gas pH and history of chronic cardiac disease. A linear logistic regression (LR) and non-linear tree-based gradient boosting (XGB) algorithm fitted the data with an AUC of 0.81 (95% confidence interval 0.77 to 0.85) and 0.82 (0.79 to 0.85), respectively, using the ten selected features. Both models outperformed age-based decision rules used in practice (AUC of 0.69, 0.65 to 0.74 for age &gt; 70). Furthermore, performance remained stable when excluding age as predictor (AUC of 0.78, 0.75 to 0.81)

**Conclusion:** Both models showed excellent performance and had better test characteristics than age-based decision rules, using ten admission features readily available in Dutch hospitals. The models hold promise to aid decision making during a hospital bed shortage.",2,t2_blqmw,2020-10-14 02:05:35,/r/COVID19/comments/jaiqqu/predicting_mortality_of_individual_covid19/g8pqlhz/,0

COVID-19 patients may exhibit neuropsychiatric and/or neurological symptoms. We found that anxiety and cognitive impairment are manifested by 28-56% of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals with mild or no respiratory symptoms and are associated with altered cerebral cortical thickness. Using an independent cohort, we found histopathological signs of brain damage in 19% of individuals who died of COVID-19. All of the affected brain tissues exhibited foci of SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in astrocytes. Infection of neural stem cell-derived astrocytes changed energy metabolism, altered key proteins and metabolites used to fuel neurons and for biogenesis of neurotransmitters, and elicited a secretory phenotype that reduces neuronal viability. Our data support the model where SARS-CoV-2 reaches the brain, infects astrocytes and triggers neuropathological changes that contribute to the structural and functional alterations in the brain of COVID-19 patients.",1,t2_blqmw,2020-10-14 02:06:09,/r/COVID19/comments/jairof/sarscov2_infects_brain_astrocytes_of_covid19/g8pqnzt/,0

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_jair2o,t3_jair2o,g8pques,"**Abstract**

Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) has been reported in several virus infections including dengue fever virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus infection.

To study whether ADE is involved in COVID-19 infections, in vitro pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 entry into Raji cells, K562 cells, and primary B cells mediated by plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients were employed as models. The enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells was more commonly detected in plasma from severely-affected elderly patients with high titers of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific antibodies. Cellular entry was mediated via the engagement of FcγRII receptor through virus-cell membrane fusion, but not by endocytosis. Peptide array scanning analyses showed that antibodies which promote SARS-CoV-2 infection targeted the variable regions of the RBD domain. To further characterize the association between the spike-specific antibody and ADE, an RBD-specific monoclonal antibody (7F3) was isolated from a recovered patient, which potently inhibited SARS-Cov-2 infection of ACE-2 expressing cells and also mediated ADE in Raji cells. Site-directed mutagenesis the spike RBD domain reduced the neutralization activity of 7F3, but did not abolish its binding to the RBD domain. Structural analysis using cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) revealed that 7F3 binds to spike proteins at a shift-angled pattern with one up and two down RBDs, resulting in partial overlapping with the receptor binding motif (RBM), while a neutralizing monoclonal antibody that lacked ADE activity binds to spike proteins with three up RBDs, resulting in complete overlapping with RBM.

Our results revealed that ADE mediated by SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies could result from binding to the receptor in slightly different pattern from antibodies mediating neutralizations. Studies on ADE using antibodies from recovered patients via cell biology and structural biology technology could be of use for developing novel therapeutic and preventive measures for control of COVID-19 infection.  ",1,t2_blqmw,2020-10-14 02:07:38,/r/COVID19/comments/jair2o/antibodydependent_enhancement_ade_of_sarscov2/g8pques/,0

&gt; All subjects had detectable ivermectin concentrations in the lungs at seven days post intervention, up to 524.3 ng/g for high-dose male and 27.3 ng/g for low-dose females. nebulized ivermectin can reach pharmacodynamic concentrations in the lung tissue of rats, additional experiments are required to assess the safety of this formulation in larger animals.

I want to know how to recreate their technique. They used alcohol to dissolve ivermectin powder -- a *lot* of alcohol. You can buy ivermectin in a water solution, so you don't have to dissolve it.

*long sigh*

So no. 3-4 months is just the endpoint of several studies looking at immunity following infection and not some magical dropoff point. All but one or two of these studies show responses that should last far longer than that, and there are methodological reasons those studies may have shown that.

Furthermore, indications from vaccine clinical trials - compared to studies of convalescent patients - show much more consistent buildup of correlates of immunity. You can have a weak infection that doesn't trigger the immune system very strongly, or you can have an infection that negatively affects your body's ability to produce lasting immune cells, but a vaccine won't do that.

*Furthermore,* antibodies will partially go away. It's what they do. They're metabolically ""expensive"" and if your body held onto every antibody it ever made to fight a disease your entire body weight would be antibodies. Your immune system will produce T-cells that recognize the virus, and B-cells that communicate with those T-cells and crank out more antibodies if needed.

With a virus or vaccine that gives you 'lifetime' immunity like measles it's actually how we recognize that someone by random chance got infected again - they often have no or very weak symptoms but instead just have a sudden jump in antibody production above whatever low baseline they normally settle into.

Same is true for seasonal cold viruses that you can get again and again - serious symptoms are rare in part because if they get past the defenses of your respiratory tract, your body immediately starts making antibodies again and keeps them out of the bloodstream.",4,t2_593zf,2020-10-14 03:00:26,/r/COVID19/comments/j9rc3r/weekly_question_thread_week_of_october_12/g8px8s8/,0

I am not going to doxx myself, but I am telling you that you should be worried from a position of much more authority than you are allowing for.

&gt;Surely they have access to the same anecdotal evidence as you seem to

Yes, they do. The problem is that in academia we have developed over many decades a culture of first, conformity to corporate and political interests, and second, of extreme risk aversion to saying anything that might sound ""alarmist"" or turn out to be wrong.

Thus the complete paralysis when faced with a rapidly moving crisis in which one has to act very quickly based on incomplete information while paying serious attention to the worst possible outcomes. 

Also, are you noticing how the vaccine and drug trials are being halted one after another right now (lots of news on that today). Why do you think this is happening? Are we going to dismiss it because we are not given more details or we are going to try to think about why that might be happening based on recently published papers (for example, the ones that show cross-reactivity of anti-SARS-2 antibodies with mammalian proteins, especially proteins involved in the nervous system)? 

What should we do in real life? Wait for everything to be properly researched and worked out to a conclusive point, which will take years, or plan for the worst possible outcomes based on the incomplete information we have?",1,t2_8d1zqt5o,2020-10-14 03:46:03,/r/COVID19/comments/ja1umc/what_reinfections_mean_for_covid19/g8q2pqs/,0

&gt;There were no RCTs. 90% of what we arrived at that delivered better outcomes, was done by looking at our patients and seeing what made sense.

Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the sole causative agent of coronavirus infectious disease-19 (COVID-19). Methods: We performed a retrospective single-center study of consecutively admitted patients between March 1st and May 15th, 2020, with a definitive diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary endpoint was to evaluate the association of lipid markers with 30-days all-cause mortality in COVID-19. Results: A total of 654 patients were enrolled, with an estimated 30-day mortality of 22.8% (149 patients). Non-survivors had lower total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) levels during the entire course of the disease with complete resolution among survivors. Both showed a significant inverse correlation with inflammatory markers and a positive correlation with lymphocyte count. In a multivariate analysis, LDL-c &lt; 69 mg/dl (hazard ratio [HR] 1.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-3.31), C-reactive protein &gt; 88 mg/dl (HR 2.44; 95% CI, 1.41-4.23) and lymphopenia &lt; 1000 cells/ml (HR 2.68; 95% CI, 1.91-3.78) at admission were independently associated with 30-day mortality. This association was maintained 7 days after admission. Conclusion: Hypolipidemia in SARS-CoV-2 infection may be secondary to an immune-inflammatory response, with complete recovery in survivors. Low LDL-c serum levels are independently associated with higher 30-day mortality in COVID-19 patients.",1,t2_4tmsh269,2020-10-14 04:10:51,/r/COVID19/comments/jaldiq/lowdensity_lipoprotein_cholesterol_levels_are/g8q5o9m/,0

I read both the protocol and the SAP, several times. 

&gt;Why is that relevant? Also FALSE, it was registered on August 24. Oh, it started on June 1. Explain why that is a problem, please.

Because the trial registry is a secure repository of the key features of your trial, and how you're going to do the study. This helps to ensure you can't change how you do the study while it's in progress, which is a primary way unscrupulous trialists can cheat the system. At the journal family I work at, none of our journals will ever accept RCTs registered after they started. It's an important issue.

&gt;?? Only the US and Western Europe can conduct meaningful research?

No, but combined with the other issues it indicates poor general trial conduct. Not all trials in LMICs are bad, of course, but the rate is certainly higher largely because regulations are much less strict and the expertise in complex trials just isn't there.

&gt;Come on, practically every trial has subjects that drop out.

Again, no trial with a per-procotol analysis would get published in the journal I work for. The issue is not that patients drop out. The issue is why they drop out, and whether you exclude those patients from the final analysis. There are very few cases when intention-to-treat is not by the more desirable analysis method, and this is not one of them.

&gt;OK, you're right about that. Doesn't invalidate the study.

It makes it *substantially* more prone to bias. In many diseases it is absolutely the case that the endpoint used is fundamental - use a nonstandard endpoint that isn't validated and you will never get approval - they'll assume (usually rightly) that you're trying to hide a lack of efficacy.

&gt;FALSE: P-Value &lt; 0.03

That p value just tests if the two enrolled treatment populations are different. It tells you nothing about whether your patient sample is representative of the population it's drawn from. In other words, sample size improves generalizability, not just statistical power.

&gt;Yes it has. Ivermectin is being used in 16 countries, probably 100s of 1000s of patients by now, maybe millions. It's part of the standard covid-19 defense (prophylaxis) and treatment in Uttar Pradash, India's largest state with 200+ million people. It's a ridiculously safe drug, if you don't have one of 2 parasites that make trouble. 4+ billion doses given to billion(s) of people over 20+ years, probably (I don't have a hard number) fewer deaths during that entire span, than the 3000/year killed annually in the UK by aspirin. There are about 10 ivermectin trials or studies reported so far, no safety problems found.

I agree safety probably isn't an issue, but even small effects - that really require tens of thousands of patients closely followed - are important when in prophylactic use. Witness the aspirin story!

&gt;I think you're working overhard to fault this study.

You might say so - my take is just that it's not a very good study, and no reputable regulator will be convinced by this setup and this data, and that's ultimately the issue.",3,t2_84pge,2020-10-14 04:13:52,/r/COVID19/comments/jadh8t/use_of_ivermectin_is_associated_with_lower/g8q61gm/,0

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_jalmza,t3_jalmza,g8q7cku,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 13, 2020-- Moderna, Inc., (Nasdaq: MRNA) a biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines to create a new generation of transformative medicines for patients, today announced the initiation of a rolling submission to Health Canada for mRNA-1273, the Company’s vaccine candidate against COVID-19. This initiation follows positive results from a preclinical viral challenge study of mRNA-1273 and the positive interim analysis of the Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273 in healthy adults (ages 18-55 years) and older adults (ages 56-70 and 71+) published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

The rolling submission has been accepted under the Canadian Minister of Health's Interim Order, which permits companies to submit safety and efficacy data and information as they become available. This rolling review process allows Health Canada to begin its assessment using the information submitted by the applicant and accept new evidence as it becomes available until the application is deemed complete. This process can reduce time to authorization for these important new drugs while maintaining appropriate standards of safety, efficacy, and quality. Health Canada will not make a decision to authorize any vaccine being considered under rolling review until it has received all necessary evidence to support its safety and efficacy. Following the authorization of any vaccine submission, Health Canada will publish the evidence used in making its decision for transparency.

On September 22, the Canadian Government increased its confirmed order commitment to 20 million doses of mRNA-1273. Moderna remains on track to be able to deliver up to 56 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine to help protect Canadians beginning in 2021. The Canadian vaccine supply will be sourced from Moderna’s European production capacity with its strategic manufacturing partner Lonza of Switzerland, and ROVI of Spain for fill-finish services.

“We are pleased with the interactions with the Canadian regulatory authorities and we appreciate their guidance and confidence in Moderna to pursue a rolling submission in Canada for our COVID-19 vaccine candidate, mRNA-1273,” said Stéphane Bancel, Moderna’s Chief Executive Officer. “We are committed to developing a safe and effective vaccine following the guidance of regulatory agencies around the world and we will continue working closely with Health Canada.”

The Phase 1 interim analysis showed that mRNA-1273 was generally well-tolerated across all age groups and induced rapid and strong immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. In the 18-55 age group, neutralizing antibody titers were observed in 100% of evaluated participants and at the 100 µg dose level selected for Phase 3, the geometric mean titers were above those seen in convalescent sera. Similarly, mRNA-1273 induced consistently high levels of pseudovirus neutralization antibody titers in all participants in the 56-70 and 71+ age groups. In addition, vaccination with mRNA-1273 elicited Th1-biased CD4 T cell responses in all age groups.

mRNA-1273 is currently being studied in a Phase 3 randomized, 1:1 placebo-controlled trial of 30,000 participants at the 100 µg dose level in the U.S. As of Friday, October 9, the Phase 3 COVE study has enrolled approximately 28,618 participants with 22,194 having received their second vaccination.

COVID19,t5_2f4l19,t3_jair2o,t3_jair2o,g8qaomg,"That's some odd mechanism. I was under the impression that ADE would require endocytosis into the immune cells, aparently direct membrane fusion is possible as well. Looks to be depndent on the angle of the AB when binding to the virion. Maybe some exposed fusion peptides could do that if the angle is right and there is room for them to squeeze through the cell membrane proteins? In that case adding the S2 protein to a sub-unit vaccine might not be such a bonkers idea after all, giving some ABs blocking the exposed fusion machinery to stop this form of ADE from happening.

Very intersting paper, bit gut churning when reading it, but as they say - ""know your enemy"". Giving severe patients a CD32 mAB shot or that peptide might be worth a try as well. Since this seems to develop quite late in the disease the timing is probably less of essence than for other treatments.

I think going for the full S protein in vaccines might have just dodged a bullett, if the results here can be replicated in vivo.


P.S. Oddly enough, there was no sign of ADE in the Innovio vaccine candidate or any of the inactivated Chinese vaccine candidates (the Chinese did go looking for it).",5,t2_4m64f7hc,2020-10-14 04:48:12,/r/COVID19/comments/jair2o/antibodydependent_enhancement_ade_of_sarscov2/g8qaomg/,0

We found that amino acid substitutions F342L and E516A on RBD allowed the virus escape from the neutralization by 7F3 without reducing binding affinity to antibody.

&gt; These results also suggest that ADE may be more likely to occur at later time points after recovery from COVID-19 when the concentration of neutralizing antibodies elicited by the primary SARS-CoV-2 infection have waned to suboptimal neutralizing level.

Available to the highest risk groups could be in January-February 2021 in Canada, and hopefully most 65+ vaccinated by April if things go right. From there on out, it becomes a mass vaccination campaign which we thankfully have experience with, seeing as we vaccinated 60% of the population with the H1N1 vaccine in a time period of 6 months, from November 2009 to April 2010. 

Still mind blowing to me that 60% of the population took the H1N1 vaccine when it was merely a mild inconvenience to life, rather than world-altering like COVID. One can assume that, with a bit more of a fire under their ass because of the impact of COVID, the federal government should be able to vaccinate every willing Canadian in 6 months again or maybe even slightly quicker depending on how prepared they are (I.e., they’re currently allowing companies to ship their vaccine into Canada before approval so that as soon as it’s approved, it can be distributed). 

I’d say if everything goes generally as it has been so far, we could look at relative normalcy WITHIN Canada by the end of spring/early summer 2021.

[Astrocytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrocyte) are structural parts of the brain and support the blood-brain barrier.

From the paper:

&gt; We performed a minimally invasive autopsy via endonasal trans-ethmoidal access of brain samples from 26 individuals who died of COVID-19 and analyzed histopathological features. We found alterations consistent with necrosis and inflammation in 19% of the brain tissues from these individuos (5/20) (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2a). Notably, SARS-CoV-2 genetic material and spike protein was detected in all of these five samples (Fig. 2b,c). SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was found in about one third of the cells in one of the slices of brain tissue analyzed (Fig. 2d), the majority of these cells being astrocytes (Fig. 2e). We also found the virus in neurons (Supplementary Fig. 2b), but not in microglia (Supplementary Fig. 2c). The presence of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein correlated with the presence of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in the infected cells (Fig. 2f), indicating replicative virus in the brain tissue.

Long story short: the virus is replicating *in brain cells*, implying the damage from SARS-CoV-2 is not just from inflammation, but from the virus itself.
