FDA needs the vaccine to be 50 efficient at 150, but if they show higher values at lower number of patients they will use that to say that they will be at 50 at 150 with a certain degree of certainty. I think Moderna only has two readouts, 75 and 150, and AZ has only one at 150, so I expect them to be the last to announce.</td>\n",

There is a study about the increase of violence in bars after midnight, and I was hoping someone could point me in the right direction for a preprint of a study or something similar. I know that closing the bars at 12 will reduce the spread, but I need some data to back it up. If you have any suggestions on what I could do, please let me know.</td>\n",

Maybe some exposed fusion peptides could do that if the angle is right and there is room for them to squeeze through the cell membrane proteins?

Viable virus here means that the recovered virus is able to infect cells in cell culture. Whether this will be enough to infect a person, nobody knows....</td>\n",

She said she was optimistic overall and there was a slim chance we d have it ready to go by the end of the year. My instinct is that what you ve heard is misguided. Phase I results for the top contenders are due in the next few months. If they all failed then we have no basis to estimate when we could expect a vaccine so end of 2021 seems too precise.</td>\n",

       "79023  My personal belief as a non American and without getting too deep into politics is that it is probably a bit of both. Given that we know half the US will simply flat out refuse to take any vaccine approved before November 3rd or in some extreme cases, anything approved under the current administration , the FDA cannot afford to be anything other than extremely cautious to avoid a mass outbreak of vaccine hesitancy.

       "79047  The most unusual thing is in regards to production where pharma companies have already put millions into making a vaccine that hasnt been approved so it can be deployed immediately on approval. The regulators in many countries are also working closer with the countries doing the trials to stop any bureaucratic obstacles that almost always happen. Funding is also not an issue which means the vaccine groups dont have to waste time searching for money. So the process is being done much quicker ...   \n",

The leading vaccines in their preclinical and phase 1 papers all produce strikingly similar, dose dependent responses, within a range. The two dose gamble is you get higher overall effectiveness at the expense of a slower rollout. The one dose gamble is effectiveness is good enough and you get faster rollout and, in a potentially crowded field of vaccines, higher uptake.   \n",

       "79071            Best shot as in the first to announce is BionTech Pfizers, they will have a read out when they hit 35 infected patients, then another at 75 and then finally at 150. FDA needs the vaccine to be 50 efficient at 150, but if they show higher values at lower number of patients they will use that to say that they will be at 50 at 150 with a certain degree of certainty. I think Moderna only has two readouts, 75 and 150, and AZ has only one at 150, so I expect them to be the last to announce.   \n",

There is no reliable way to say that anyone is not infected. Even the swabs have a lot of false negatives. If someone has low blood oxygen level, they are by definition not asymptomatic, even if they feel completely normal otherwise.   \n",

Even if the rapid tests are less sensitive than more expensive tests that take longer, they will detect more infected people before they can spread the illness because more people will be able to test themselves more often. It is highly frustrating that this conceptual understanding is not more widespread at this point. More information Ov...   \n",

       "79226   Abstract Virologic testing for SARS CoV 2 has been central to the COVID 19 pandemic response, but interpreting changes in incidence and fraction of positive tests towards understanding the epidemic trajectory is confounded by changes in testing practices. Here, we show that the distribution of viral loads, in the form of Cycle thresholds Ct , from positive surveillance samples at a single point in time can provide accurate estimation of an epidemics trajectory, subverting the need for repea...   \n",

But the purpose of the model doesnt really seem to be to demonstrate anything vaccine related and rather just to demonstrate that the severity of the first wave informs the level of NPIs needed moving forward in a non intuitive way.   \n",

Looks to be depndent on the angle of the AB when binding to the virion. Maybe some exposed fusion peptides could do that if the angle is right and there is room for them to squeeze through the cell membrane proteins? In that case adding the S2 protein to a sub unit vaccine might not be such a bonkers idea after all, giving some A...   \n",

Available to the highest risk groups could be in January February 2021 in Canada, and hopefully most 65 vaccinated by April if things go right. From there on out, it becomes a mass vaccination campaign which we thankfully have experience with, seeing as we vaccinated 60 of the population with the H1N1 vaccine in a time period of 6 months, from November 2009 to April 2010.

Essentially, this means that the pre orders the government made for Moderna, Pfizer, and AZ are now valid to be imported into Canada since they qualify as an application submitted under Section 3 4 I believe.

Personally, I think this is an issue with mask messaging in that people are being led to believe that the barrier effects are large. This doesnt negate their being a difference though.
